         I love when my children stay up late outdoors in the summertime, jumping and hollering and whacking each other, coming to bed with sweaty heads and pink cheeks, sparkling eyes and a few captive fireflies to show me before their release. The life and breath, rush and clamor of it all is exhilarating. 

 I also love when they are tucked up sweetly into their beds with books at a shockingly early hour and I, all alone, get to turn out my lights and silently watch green leaves sway rustling and cool outside the window. I munch my evening Cheerios from a deeply still inner pool of peace. Fireflies wink and twinkle in the long grass. 

 No in-between stuff for me.
