My man makes me laugh.

The laughter breaks out unexpectedly like sunshine through storm clouds, or builds gradually to a great crescendo of hilarity. Sometimes it merely punctuates the busyness of life with a wry comic twist.

Whatever the form, it is always right there simmering under the surface of every circumstance, lurking between our glances and peeking from the chinks of our experience.

I donâ€™t know that anyone can have shared as much life as we have without unintentionally creating vast reservoirs of laughter to dip into at need.
