Well, umm, yes. I did sort of fail on my promise to write about the sonogram. I say sort of because I actually did write, but then forgot to post it. Because right now I am Ellie Space Ditz. And I do not actually feel bad because I do not think anyone out there is so wrapped up in my life as to be chewing their nails over my sonogram. But I did promise, if only to myself, and it is a very silly sort of fail. Though not as silly as some I’ve known lately…

So here is my post, rather late, but refrigerator fresh:

Before our ultrasound Steven and Polly were discussing the mutually exclusive goods of each possibility while she did flips off his knees.

“Well, you’ll either get to have a sister, or else you’ll stay my only and very favorite little girl in the whole world.”

She stopped, arrested mid flip. This was an angle unconsidered.

The doctor saw a boy. Heck, everyone saw a boy. Our babies are not noted for shyness.

Polly’s throne remains unchallenged. Meanwhile, several of her brothers have joined her in My Little Pony love, so who needs a sister anyway?
