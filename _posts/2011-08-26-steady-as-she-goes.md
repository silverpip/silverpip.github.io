         Thus ends our first week back in the homeschooling saddle. And I am happy to report there was a lot less chafing than predicted. 

 My goal this year is _sustainability_: remember less is more, add things gradually, and of course… don’t panic. 

 Becoming truly skilled at the glorious art of daily life is, perhaps, a dream, but I will call it vision instead and plunge in after it. 

 Steering clear of the crash and burn cycle, I hope to make harbor in May with a precious cargo of contented children who are still cracking jokes and sparkling with interest in the world around.
