        This is my favorite Easter song!

(I recommend playing the video, but turning off your screen so that you can focus better.)

_I know that my Redeemer liveth,  
 and that He shall stand at the latter day upon the earth.  
 And thoâ€™ worms destroy this body,  
 yet in my flesh shall I see God. I know that my Redeemer liveth:  
 For now is Christ risen from the dead,  
 the first fruits of them that sleep._
