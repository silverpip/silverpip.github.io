<h2>Sackcloth and Plastic Eggs</h2><p>There is a beautiful, round tree in our backyard full of little redberries when the nights get cool in autumn (I don’t know yet what itdoes in spring or summer, as we just moved in September.) Peter brokeoff its lower branches one afternoon– no small feat– until weexplained to him what this did to the tree. He was crushed, offcourse, but there’s no undoing a deed like that. Since then, we havelonged hopefully for greenery to bud and drape and mercifully veilthose bottom bits.Last week I walked outside to behold that little tree festooned inplastic Easter eggs. Our neighbor-friends (with whom we share a yard)had clothed our sad plant in festival colors. It was celebrating. Itmade me want to celebrate, once I stopped laughing.</p><p></p>Sometimes I feel rather like that short, wobegone tree, draped inearly splendour. Broken, marred, God’s image in me disfigured, I mournand I rend my heart. But Easter peeks through Lent’s cracks, thetransfiguring glory of joy adorns me at unexpected moments and infunny ways.And the tree and I, oddly radiant in our dangling eggs, wait longingfor the unfurling of our great graceful leafy swathes.</article>
