        Leave me here with my Lord. Leave me with my grief.

Take your kind, awkward Sunday words someplace else this Friday.

Give me room to weep and rend my heart. Stop talking about resurrection for a minute. Just for a minute, stay quiet with me at his tomb.

I could not watch with him an hour; I could not keep my fast with him a full season.

I may at least adore his broken body.

I will sing with you on Easter morning. I promise to rise up in your congregation and bless the living God with a thousand blessings. I promise to lift up my face, radiant in a joy impossible without grief.

Don’t rush me. I know Sunday’s coming, but right now it’s still Friday.
