My parents live atop a hill so steep that the road to it should qualify as a black diamond ski-slope. My heart beats wildly and my knees shake whenever I pull into their garage, and I sit for a long moment in the driver’s seat, keys dangling from a silent ignition, thankful that I and my passengers are still in one piece.

Yesterday Thomas and William were helping to haul fallen logs from the backyard. It was manly work, with plenty of grunting and deep-voiced camaraderie and rides to and fro in the all-terrain garden wagon until the moment these two mighty woodsmen of eight and six swaggered into the kitchen and announced that the last pile of logs couldn’t be moved because there were too many slugs. Their gray-haired granny had to sort that one, and what with one thing and another, the wagon was left out.

Several calm and peaceful hours later, as I sipped some tea and congratulated myself on a day well gotten-through, I was surprised to hear Polly having a fit of absolute hysterics in the driveway.

Nick sat halfway down the hill, white-faced and weeping, next to an overturned green wagon. Neighbors (none of whom I had ever met) poured from their doors, one even trying to phone an ambulance (which was a little premature, since Nick was surprisingly whole.) It was a lot to take in all at once.

Of course, they had been giving each other rides. And of course, they had never meant to hurtle down the hill (though I wasn’t certain at first.) But it’s all fun and games until the handle slips from someone’s little fingers and someone else speeds down, down, down, and they were both so badly shaken by the excitement of it all that their conversation is still sprinkled with references in hushed and holy tones, as though having lived through some cataclysmic Biblical event which has shaped their world forever.  

Which it probably has.
