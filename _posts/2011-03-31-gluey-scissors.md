My four big boys and I sprawled over the table, hands full of scissors   
and Scotch tape and sticky gluestick bits, happily surrounded by   
little bits of colored paper and arcane instructions, piecing together   
a model Viking village. 

 It just felt so good to be there with them, working away, sharing a   
project, not running after a pair of busy 15 month old hands and feet,   
unable to help or join without releasing Baby Leviathon into their   
midst. 

 It was like stepping into someone else’s life for a moment: a   
homeschooler without a baby. I have to admit, it was a lot easier, and   
full of a different kind of fun, but so much less fuzzy fuzzy cute   
cute. We were all happy to have Nick and Polly back from Grammy’s (and   
gosh thanks, Grammy, for the morning o’ crafty goodness!)
