        When either Steven or myself go out for an evening, we’re liable to return to chaos and a grumpy partner. The ideal of a quiet after-dinner stroll to the park, followed by cheerful family clean-up and some board games or read alouds just isn’t always feasible for two parents, much less one on their own. The house, on those nights, is much more likely to be trashed, filled with the bleeping of video games, and one lone frazzled parent mopping dog vomit and/or baby poo off the floor.

So imagine my delight when, walking in last night, I discovered a picture perfect family playing together with their littlest brother. Nick held up his new wooden car with enormous washer-wheels for my inspection, announcing proudly that he had made it with Daddy’s hammer.

I don’t know what mighty magic Steven pulled out, to be calmly making toys with his youngest children all together in the woodshop, but this silvery autumn night belongs to the realm of storybooks and tales of the old country.

Keep it coming, Steven. You’re the best. Ever.
