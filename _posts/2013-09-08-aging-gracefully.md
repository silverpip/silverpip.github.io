        A tiny woman lives around my alley corner, in a trim red house with yellow windows. She and her man, gray, stooped with age, walk very slowly.

But her flowers bloom all summer and fall, and her vegetables climb neatly in pretty rows. Her laundry dries white on a clothesline over the sweet green grass, and a big classic canoe lives atop their truck because they take it out so often.

Today, she joked a moment over her fence with me and my children. I looked into those crinkly lines around her eyes, seeing all the smiles she had ever smiled etched deeply upon her face.

I had to resist a ridiculous urge to curtsy.

This old, beautiful lady is a picture of life held to one place; focused, honed, edited, nourished until the beautifulness spills over everything she touches.

There are so many good ways to grow old, but certainly this must be one of the best.
