         Verses about waiting _on_ God (and eagle’s wings and such) only ever run through my head when I am waiting _for_ God… as in, to do something _for_ _me_. 

 Not that I’m pursing any lips at the act of waiting _for_. It just occurs to me that that is an entirely separate act from waiting _on, _which must have something more to do with standing-at-the-ready, or participating somehow in the Divine Life, or at least paying attention. 

 All these seem to require a lifetime for fruition. 

 Shoot. That really cuts into my instant gratification.
