        Pippy Longstocking is my mentor. It is wonderful to do things the wrong way. I like knowing all about the right way, and then wandering off under some wayward muse. Take floor-washing: Yes, I know that getting down on my hands and knees is the _right_ way to wash my kitchen floor, and I do it when desperate times call, but after years of experimentation I have finally found that special, _wrong_ way that makes the stars dance.

Simply squeeze a soaked dishcloth out over my floor several times until all areas are well dripped. Stand on an old bath towel and drag my feet around and into the corners. Throw my various cloths into the laundry, and voila! Simultaneously clean and dry! Other people must wash floors this way, surely. I cannot possibly be the only one to have reached enlightenment.

What I really hate is a mop. Not only is it not the right way, it is even less effective than the wrong way and involves tricky storage issues. It’s also a lot more set-up and tear-down intensive than the right way. Yet my search for a perfect mop commenced the moment I married and ended only last year by throwing the whole lot in a dumpster. How did mops ever reach such heights of assumed necessity?

Unless perhaps for a very large open area… a stone milking barn in some picturesque rural village… surrounded by snowy hills, with sleighbells jingling closer…

Yes, I might be prevailed upon to use a mop under those particular conditions.
