        Many metaphors have been spoken to describe Godâ€™s love for me, his work in me. Every one has been helpful in its own time, with themes surrounding some for whole seasons of my life.

But the one I come back to, every year and every season, in times both of great joy and deep sorrow, is the gardener. 

I long to be his garden, bringing forth abundant life. Walled or fielded; growing flowers, vegetables, or wildlife habitats; formally laid or a jungley riot, in every season this metaphor feeds me.

I lay myself out before my gardener and drink deeply of all his rains. The foggy drizzle which soaks through to my very bottom bits, the gentle spring rains, or the wild tempests of autumn. Even the bracing chill sleet of winter I spread my heart wide for.

It is well. It shall be most well. And all manner of thing shall be well.
