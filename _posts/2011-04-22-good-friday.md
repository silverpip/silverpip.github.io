_Lachrimae Amantis (Tears of Love), by Geoffrey Hill_

_What is there in my heart that you should sue _  
_so fiercely for its love? What kind of care _  
_brings you as though a stranger to my door _  
_through the long night and in the icy dew_

_seeking the heart that will not harbour you, _  
_that keeps itself religiously secure? _  
_At this dark solstice filled with frost and fire _  
_your passion’s ancient wounds must bleed anew._

_So many nights the angel of my house _  
_has fed such urgent comfort through a dream, _  
_whispered ‘your lord is coming, he is close’_

_that I have drowsed half-faithful for a time _  
_bathed in pure tones of promise and remorse: _  
_'tomorrow I shall wake to welcome him.'_

“Now! Now! Why do I say tomorrow? I must wake now to him!” I cry. Why do I drowse while_passion’s ancient wounds bleed anew_? What will open my eyes and move my limbs so that I may run to him?
