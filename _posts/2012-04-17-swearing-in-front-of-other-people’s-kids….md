        I thought I had emptied the coffee pot already. It turns out I was confused with yesterday. So when I put the coffee-maker away, it tipped sideways and spilled all over: inside, outside, upside down my pots and pans and bags of potatoes, into the nether reaches of my cupboard. So of course I took a quick moment to swear roundly before getting a towel. “Dammit!”

“Hello?” a sweet, unsure little voice called from my screen door. Whirling around, I beheld the small daughter of our lovely Mormon neighbors, who would not only never swear, but would never ever have brewed any coffee to begin with.

Oops.
