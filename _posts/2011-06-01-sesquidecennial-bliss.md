 It is our fifteenth wedding anniversary today. Looking back over the years: yes, there have been a few memorable moments when we have each been sadder and wiser people on account of the other; but taken all together, what’s not to love? 

 Steven tells me I have a selective memory, and blesses it. I believe he underestimates himself and does not realize how his gentleness and honesty smooths the way. 

 Really, everything is just that much better with him. And at the end of the day, there’s no one I’d rather watch my back. And, well… he makes me laugh. And laugh. And laugh.
