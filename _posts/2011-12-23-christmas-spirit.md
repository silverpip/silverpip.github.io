        I’ve had some trouble getting into the swing of Christmas this year. Just some mild tiredness here, some two-year-old-around-ness there, some it-moves-too-quick-for-me-ness all around.

But a ruined pecan pie turned into the tastiest caramel-nut candy I’ve ever eaten. We just scoop the filling out of a burned crust with sharp knives and eat with sticky fingers. It’s very visceral and primitive, not to mention purely accidental. And funnily enough, I suddenly feel festive.

No, there’s nothing like burned pecan pie for the holidays.

I can never recreate such deliciousness: it was two days of misadventure in the making. So we will enjoy it as the fleeting, ephemeral happenstance it is, and hope for more such Christmas disasters to come.
