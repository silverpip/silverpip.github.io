 I took four of the children to have a beautiful quiet evening at the library while the other two were busy with guitar lessons. But I think I have decided to leave library visits to the bright-eyed mornings from now on. 

 First of all, we had to change the clothes they’d been revelling outdoors in all day, and comb down Polly’s ruffled locks, as the library is in really quite a snooty part of town and the other patrons are rawther put-together dahling. 

 Then baby Nick _would_ keep screaming murder at anyone else happening to lay a finger on the special toy shopping cart, and careering through the stacks with it every chance he got. A wee bit embarrassing, but I can handle some raised eye-brows here and there. 

 Finally managing to curl up in a corner with Thomas and his special book, I was suddenly lambasted by blood-curdling screams erupting from around another shelf in a continuous storm of passion. Normally I might let things go a bit to see if they work themselves out, but as other adults started craning their necks around, I thought I’d better have a look. 

 I found Polly and Nick in a violent headlock, thrashing around on the carpet (because of that !@\#-insert mommy word-!@\# grocery cart, of course.) After hissing a few emergency _“because I said so’s”_ in front of everyone’s curiously disapproving (but very well-put-together) stares, the two miscreants were eventually shushed. But I was definitely _that mom_ by now. Thomas and I hid behind his book. I pulled what shreds of comfort I could from the knowledge that I was at least wearing a jazzy headband and none of them had six kids (not that I did either, just then.) I take what I can get. 

 Moments later, I heard an overly sweet voice at the bulletin board saying, “Oh no, little boy. Leave the pretty pictures there!” and looked up to see Nick gleefully extracting push-pins. Who left push-pins at that level in a children’s department, anyway? Certainly no one with children. Dutifully thanking the woman, who gave me her kindest _“I’m not judging you for being such a wretchedly terrible mother, because really, there’s hope for even you”_ smile, I gave up on poor Thomas’ book, promising a cozy read at home. 

 Polly had to use the potty. Again. For a long time. I spent that time chasing Nick through the stalls and trying unsuccessfully to keep him out of other toilets. 

 An indecisive Peter needed some help selecting just the perfect free book for his summer reading prize, while Nick dumped out crayon baskets and scattered their colorful contents, only to discover that someone had touched the special grocery cart during his short absence. 

 I decided a drizzly wait on the sidewalk was more appealing than a library at this exact moment, so we tried to leave, but the rotten self-checkout machine kept timing out because _I_ kept stopping in order to block Nick and Polly from running out the automatic doors into the street. Finally I had to ask a librarian to come check me out. How mortifying. That was the moment Nick decided to have an explosive poo all over both of us. I returned to the bathroom, carrying one indignant toddler and trailed by three longsuffering others, and realized in despair that I’d left my wipes in the car (which was with Steven at guitar lessons) and that this library had rid itself of all paper towels for the good of mankind and mother earth. I have never, ever felt less interested in environmental issues in my life. 

 I’m sure there was applause from those staid and respectable citizens after the doors closed behind our backs. As for us, Polly threw her skirt over her head and wailed, “_Mommy, I pee’d on my dress!_” 

 Libraries are not for the faint of heart.
