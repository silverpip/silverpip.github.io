I remember really liking road trips when I was young and crazy. Steven and I would pack up our Green Machine in a few minutes and get on the road, munching cheetos and drinking Coke for 22 hours straight. We’d stop in at Cracker Barrel to exchange audio books now and then (remember back before mp3s?) or read ourselves hoarse if we couldn’t find the book we wanted (the selections could be a little sketchy), or just chat and dream together, eating up the miles and sleeping when we got there. I still remember sunrise over the Kentucky Bluegrass Highway: it was a halfway mark tradition, and it makes me smile even now.

Somehow, car drives have lost much of their glamour over the years. Counting bathroom stops has a dark sort of humour all its own, of course, and the chatty aspect is still fun: as long as the baby is sleeping and no one drifts over into anyone else’s seat or sneaks a french fry, some chill time just passing the moment together can be pretty great. And let’s not forget grooving to John Denver all through West Virginia. Downloading _Thank God I’m a Country Boy_ on a 3G cell phone in transit might just make that mountain mama’s man roll over in his grave.

Okay, so maybe there’s still some charm left in the open road, even if goldfish crackers have replaced our cheetos.
