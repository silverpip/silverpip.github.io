        I admire nurses with an ardency reserved for the wholly other. They are so competent, their fingers deft, their manner quick and sure. So many doors of usefulness and blessing open to them, from inner-city clinics and overseas emergency relief to church nursery assistance (where they managed to staunch Thomas’ wound) to yes, even the children’s hospital a few miles away, where they effortlessly sewed up his finger and made him smile into the bargain. (How does one draw such gushing cataracts of blood with round-ended Sunday School scissors, I ask you?)

When I muse on what I might have been in some alternate universe, nursing tops the list. To be so helpful and practical, so wanted.

But there are few vocations, perhaps with the exception of waitressing, for which I am worse equipped. Among the many friends and relations who love me patiently and cheerfully endure the chaos of my wake, there are none who would in any time of crisis call out, “Quick: get Ellie! She’ll fix everything!”

I’d better stick to poetry and admire all those hands-on, competent people from afar. As long as I keep out from underfoot they’ll like me fine, and maybe in a fit of usefulness I could read to their patients and roll bandages. Even smooth a fevered brow or two. But I insist on a jazzy white skirt and cap.
