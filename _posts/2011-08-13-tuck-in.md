         Other peopleâ€™s parties are a great perk of duplex living. They can also be a great drawback, but as long as we stay out of the campus sector and keep families next door, parties just hum along, despite the odd lightsaber wound to the ear. 

 It is lovely to pile out of the car around bedtime and send big kids scampering to a campfire lit, maintained, and presided over by adults other than ourselves for some light marshmallow roasting. Meanwhile, we are free to trundle little ones inside for a quiet tuck-in. 

 Breaking bedtime into bite-sized chunks is nice. I can understand why some families have more than one bedroom.
