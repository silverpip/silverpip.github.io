        William and Thomas are visiting my parents for two weeks of brotherly adventure and grandmotherly pampering: a fine combination at any age.

As it turns out, that thing parents always say about the individual-person-shaped hole in their (or God’s) hearts is actually true. I know they’re having a wonderful time, so I’m making the most of my own, but the impish sparkle in Thomas’ eyes as he peeks around a corner and the hilariously goofy cuddle-smile by which William manages to give hugs clear across a room are flat out missing, and life is just that much flatter without them.

So while I wouldn’t trade this special time with the five other gigantic personalities illuminating my house, I’m awfully glad those particular lights are coming back.

And of course the dog is languishing.
