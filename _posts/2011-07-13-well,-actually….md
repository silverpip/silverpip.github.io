 I had to drive a car again today. –_sighs and tears–_ 

 Rush hour, construction, broken air conditioner, everyone hungry, screaming baby: the usual. The _unusual_ thing was that I remained calm. In fact, it may have been my one calm moment all day. 

 When at last we were home I thanked Polly and Thomas for being so patient throughout the ordeal. 

 Polly squinched up her nose at me and confessed, “We weren’t patient at all, _actually_. We kept saying that you were _never_ going to let us out of the car again.” 

 I love that girl.
