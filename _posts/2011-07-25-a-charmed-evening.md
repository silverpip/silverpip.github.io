        We braved the library again. Magically, all the other toddlers were pleased to be Nickâ€™s fan club. Which meant, of course, that they loaded the toy grocery cart and he pushed it. So the rest of us peacefully cuddled up with a few choice Cynthia Rylants and had ourselves a simply beautiful time. And no one had to use the toilet even once. You just never know what sort of night the library has in store.
