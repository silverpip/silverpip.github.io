        The things I love about running are all the unlooked for side effects that really seem to come about by accident. Blood singing in my veins. Alertness and an increased capacity for cheerfulness. Pink sunrise in my face and little bird chirps from the trees. The sheer freedom of being all alone for a half hour.

But these things never, ever actually motivate me to start up again after a break. Perversely, it is only the fear of flab which laces up my shoes and boots me out the door. Once out, the joy of it all takes me in hand and I couldn’t care less which jeans fit. I seem to be morbidly concerned with my weight only when I’m not doing anything about it.

A sure sign I need to get running again so I can worry about more interesting things.
