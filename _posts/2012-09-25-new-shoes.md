Steven gave me a whole evening to buy shoes. Which is great, since by the time I had lost both myself in the tangled labyrinth of mall-world, and my car (I left by the wrong exit), scrambled up a steep embankment through the shrubbery in order to reach the other parking lot, then realized I needed to go the other way and slid back down again, a full evening was necessary.

And though the actual shoe-choosing part was by far the smallest percentage of my adventure, it colored the rest with a rose-hued glow of satisfaction. What matter hedges and hills when tackled in fabulous shoes? I adore my new Merrell Barefoot runners with a passion reserved for childhood.

Stevenâ€™s grandmother tells of the time her little girl picked out a pair of new red shoes, and slept with them next to her pillow. I understand. Mine were on the floor, but still neatly close by my side.
