Nearly fifteen years ago, I was so moved by the sight of clustering   
white blossoms overhanging a nearby path, that I gathered armfuls of   
the branches, and filled our hilarious newlywed trailer-home with   
them. Sure, they smelled a little funny, but I was so eager for their   
transforming beauty I overlooked that. An hour later, Steven came home. One step inside the door and he   
started sniffing suspiciously. “What is that horrible smell?” he   
asked. “Did you leave fish out?….. Ack, it’s these flowers!”   
Watching him dump jar after jar of frothy twigs outside, his shoulders   
shaking with laughter, I was crushed. Dreams of beauty vanished along   
with the flowers. Then, inevitably, my own laughter surfaced. The   
whole situation was just too ridiculous. Every year since then, in   
every city we have lived in, there have been what we call Fish Trees.   
They carry a peculiar, cloying scent which I can now admit is truly   
horrible. And every spring we laugh and laugh as they blossom around   
us, remembering that trailer where we started figuring it all out   
together. 

 Last week, Polly saw a robin hopping just a few feet ahead of her. She   
wanted so badly to hug it, love it, make it her own. But it wouldn’t   
let her close, whatever she tried. After the robin finally flew away,   
she was so sad and confused.  Oh Polly, sometimes if you try to hold loveliness, it just makes your   
house smell like fish.
