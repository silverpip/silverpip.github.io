We trooped in late to evening Mass on campus, disheveled after a day of muddy tag. Thomas’ hand was bandaged to the hilt, and there were a few naps skipped. Looking down the long row of wiggly, whispering children, I saw Steven capping the far end and solemnly tuning out the kids’ commotion as deftly as I (perhaps more deftly than our poor neighbors).

His face so dear, every line so familiarly loved, the quick shift of shoulder and mouth, so perfectly known but rarely thought of. And the question came with a gaspy sort of inside laugh, “How did we get here?”

All those children, all that knowing and loving and life: it just happened along the way. I felt so old and happy, but not a bit wise. Just sort of gladly ridiculous among the surrounding sea of bright young college faces.
