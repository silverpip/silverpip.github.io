        We burn incense as we join ourselves to the worship of the Church in all times and at all places. It shows us our prayers rising up to God, perhaps a little like spraying fog to reveal lasers surrounding a precious work of art (you know, if we were cat burglars.)

I poured out our tea today and was startled to come truly awake for a split second, finding myself on holy ground: steam curling from our mugs, wafting toward heaven, bearing with it the humble service and intercession we make here daily for each other in our mundane routines. Joining myself to all others in all times and places who have presented the work of their hands as worship.

Serving tea best sums up the many and sundry jobs I do all day: in drinking it we are warmed, nourished, comforted; we are given a space for thought and conversation. And now it also reminds me that my work is prayer. 

_Ora et labora_, baby.
