We like to hike. It’s a pretty cheap outing, and a graduate student’s stipend doesn’t usually stretch to fancy entertainments, but I think we would like to hike anyway: it’s so simple. We prefer small, manageable bits of wilderness, unpaved, but still clearish and well enough maintained for a 15 month old’s tricky footwork.

Today’s was one such hike, filled with moss covered stones, wild raspberry canes interweaving bare branches, creating secret pockets of stillness.

The boys begged hard to go off-path, so finally we all plunged (slid) down through a creek bottomed gorge and struggled our way across to the other side, panting and damp and somewhat scraped.

In the middle of an especially scrambly bit, my true love looked back at me and grinned and I knew again, with my arms full of slippy slidey children, that even when life, or this particular hike, goes in ways I had not planned for; when the toddler falls into the mud, or the dissertation won’t write itself, or our family spills out over the edges of our tiny apartment, he’s in it with me for the long haul, and that’s just plain better than the plan.
