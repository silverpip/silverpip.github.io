 William and I made a banner together for his first communion service. We arranged his name, and a big felt cross with a white dove smack in the center, predictably. Then he began to set out the sparkling plastic gems. I watched, mesmerized, as he carefully placed each one perfectly reflected by the same one on the other side. I mentioned how much I liked his symmetry. “Oh yes,” he replied, unhesitating. “I like things in matching patterns. It bothers me if there are an odd number on one side and an even number on the other.” He quite waxed poetic about patterning. I was astounded by his degree of self-knowlege, even self-assurance. William had clearly put a lot of thought into this sort of thing for a long time. 

 My own thoughts follow spiralling patterns or circles. They grow in webs and connect surprisingly along uncharted paths. I find echoes and shadows interesting. Direct correspondence does not hold my attention, and my wheels spin when I try to get from point A to point B in a straight line. 

 I raise this symmetrical, mathematical child with fear and trembling. I have no idea what I’m doing.
