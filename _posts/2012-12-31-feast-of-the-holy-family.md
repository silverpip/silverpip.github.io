        It occurs to me that Christ was born into a time when absolutely everyone was either traveling to or hosting extended family. I, at least, tend to think of the family side of Christmas as being a distraction (even a nice distraction is still a distraction) from the whole point and devotional aspect of my celebration.

But I realized this year the exquisitely Franciscan nature of cramming all sorts of far-flung relations together. Just as St. Francis introduced the method-acting practice of a living nativity, visiting relations throws us into a similar predicament to those welcoming Jesus.

And then, smack in the middle of the twelve days, comes the Feast of the Holy Family.

He comes to make _our_ families holy, too. Thank goodness. Because someone’s got to. And clearly, it’s not me.
