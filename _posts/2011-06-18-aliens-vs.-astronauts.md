 Best. Nerf-game. Ever. 

 Start with one alien; everyone else is an astronaut. Each astronaut gets six nerf darts for their gun. If the alien touches them, they also become an alien and in turn tag other astronauts. If an astronaut shoots an alien, the alien must stand in one place and regenerate for ten seconds. After three minutes, a timer signals that the rescue ship has landed and any surviving astronaut(s) must reach the prespecified landing pad untouched. If any do, then the astronauts have won. If none make it, then the aliens take the day. 

 Make sure the aliens make proper alien noises and do proper regeneration dances.Those are absolutely vital to the success of their mission.
