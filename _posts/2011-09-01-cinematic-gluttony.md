         I know no better nurse for the wait-it-out stomach bug than a really engrossing film. So it is that House Brown has shown movie after movie upstairs, downstairs, and in my lady’s chamber continually for the past two days. It seemed an excellent chance to catch up on all those BBC miniseries, so I started with _North and South_… quickly growing obsessed and watching the whole thing twice in a row. I believe I could enjoy it a third time right now, if I hadn’t a shred of self-control. 

 That brooding image of John Thornton stalking through looms and jennies amidst surreal snowfalls of cotton: I just can’t shake it. And it is possibly the most romantic movie I’ve ever seen. 

 A story which is both brooding and beautiful (and up to snuff, no less) is a treasure. Perhaps I will go watch it one more time after all… but wait. It seems the bellies are mending and the movie machines are grinding to a halt. Well, perhaps during our next stomach bug.
