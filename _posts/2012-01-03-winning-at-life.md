We’re watching the Amazing Race as a family. It’s our foray into reality TV. And something very interesting to me, is the sheer unflappability of the long term winners. Not a sufficient cause for winning in itself, cheerful unflappability does seem a necessary quality of every winning team. Sometimes they develop it, sometimes they start with it, but it’s always there before they finish, whether they’re winning in the short term or not. I don’t know whether other reality TV winners have this quality, or if it’s particular to the Amazing Race, but I’m betting they all do. Because as I look around, it is the cheerfully unflappable who seem to win at life, period. And my question is, how did they learn this? And can I learn it now?
