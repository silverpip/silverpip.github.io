        Every once in a while, a shining moment flashes out clear and golden. Things work, flow, come together.

Jack finds a beetle on his shoe. Nick is actually interested in three sections and feathery antennae. Polly asks whether insects live in houses, and exactly what is the difference between a burrow and a barrow? Peter makes jokes on topic. And I get to sit on a blanket of soft dry pine needles under slowly swaying branches, breathing in a spicy smell of sap and really knowing that all actually _will_ be well.

These moments never seem to happen when I plan for them. Or even when I angle. They are pure gift.
