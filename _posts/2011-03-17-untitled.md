<h2>The Big Bad Wolf</h2><p>Every time I read a book illustrated by Trina Schart Hyman I am transported. I am drawn so deeply into her pictures, into what her pictures say about the characters and the world around them, and about how they impact that world simply by who they are in it, that I can barely read the words my first time through. The children are very patient as my voice trails off mid-sentence again and again. Eventually we finish, and then they know they can ask for seconds. Because Mom clearly loves this book, and maybe feels a little guilty about losing the thread on them so often. We read it until we are all pickled in Trina Schart Hyman goodness.</p>One goes a long way, so I save her books and sprinkle them through our rotations. Today we read Little Red Riding Hood. After the third time, I managed to get the story pretty fluent and felt quite pickled enough for one afternoon, so went off to wash some dishes. A few minutes later I glanced out the kitchen window to see two little heads perched on a bin, poring over the beautiful pages. Polly had brought it ouside to show her next door neighbor, because of course he needed to see such a book! They pointed and chatted for ages out there in the backyard, perfectly comfortable together, sorting out a wicked wolf and the fearsomeness of the world through the safety of these fairy tale pictures.<p></p>I feel exactly the same way.
