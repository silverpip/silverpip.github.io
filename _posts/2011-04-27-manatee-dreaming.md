         I am endlessly fascinated by the manatees at our zoo. I watch them, slow, peaceful, content with bobbing heads of lettuce, long after the rest of my family has moved on to sea turtles and stingrays. Then my mommy-sense buzzes and I run to catch up, but continue to turn those manatees over and over in my mind until long after we have walked back through those entrance gates (which are plastered with giant tree-frog posters even though there is not a single tree frog to be found in the zoo. I say, false advertising.) 

 I have decided I want to be more like a manatee when I grow up. What do they do? They float, they eat greens, they cuddle and play with their babies. They heal after being cut by propellers. I have not seen a single instance of driven ambition among them. They don’t even have a jean size. And they certainly don’t fret about finding the perfect curriculum. 

 Manatees are altogether lovely.
