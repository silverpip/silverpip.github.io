I apologize for my lack of early announcement. There are a few notable people in Steven’s professional life who are extremely antagonistic to our procreative tendencies, and in the midst of his late dissertation frenzy, we just felt he didn’t need the extra emotional strain their knowing about a seventh little Brown might bring.

I must further explain that we are thrilled to have each of you know and celebrate life with us, and those of you we only talk to in internet land were not intentionally excluded from this knowledge. Once the all-clear sounded and Steven’s papers were signed and the horrible sack of a dissertation rolled from our shoulders, I was sick and exhausted and not spending much time saying anything to the internet, under the principle that if I couldn’t say anything nice I shouldn’t say anything at all.

I feel quite well now, and cheerful into the bargain, which is not least of my uncountable blessings. We will find out next week whether it is a boy or a girl, and I will post to let you know, I promise.
