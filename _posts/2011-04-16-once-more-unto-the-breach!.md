 Every home in which we have lived, be it tiny or tinier, has included a Closet of Doom. I think everyone has something like this, a space to cram with homeless things. The junk drawer, the tool chest, the Closet of Doom. Only now it has grown into a Basement of Doom, and that is a scary, scary thing. 

 I deeply admire people who sort their homes and belongings regularly; I even know a few of them, and they are all so very much nicer to me than I would have expected, given my own near inability to interface with the physical world in any way. And what one aberrantly snotty lady said to me once, “I am an organized person, therefore I am a peaceful person,” is actually often true, however much it incensed me at the time. I have resigned myself to a peace entirely within my own head. I hope that its sketchy address doesn’t also mean it’s fictitious, but I’m open to the possibility. 

 In any case, the basement must be conquered! And it will have to be done the old-fashioned way, since months of trying to convince Steven to just put it all out on the curb and start over (my usual method of dealing with paper clutter and other unpleasant realities) haven’t panned out. 

 He has a very frugal mind.
