 My brother’s house burned to a crumbling shell this afternoon, and though thankfully everyone was out, the drama is intense. Heroic firemen rescuing the dogs, a charred guitar brought out victoriously upon the lawn, my sister-in-law’s smoke blackened but unburnt wedding dress carried tenderly to the car, a very special blankie and two stuffed animals hugged close: so many emotions packed into such a very short space. 

 Their neighbor is a volunteer fireman, adored by their boys, kind and very quiet. He was away today and showed up after the fire was out, though coming as soon as he heard. The boys ran to him in tears, crying “Patrick, Patrick, why were you gone? If you had been here it never would have happened!” 

 This strong, silent man didn’t say a word. Kneeling down, he put his arms around the children and wept with them. It was the best thing he could have done. 

 I don’t understand a bit why these things happen. But I do believe Jesus weeps with us.
