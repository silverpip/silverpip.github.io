We are returned from Grandpa’s funeral, safe and sound and ready to jump back into the fray.

There is something extremely grounding about the memorial service of a truly good man, who has fathered forth fully three visible generations of more truly good men. The staggering power of an ordinary life lived lovingly brought home both the urgency and the possibility of such a life for everyone, and I must admit to being quite inspired to keep on in my own rather ordinary and lovingish life, investing in this world, in individuals. For me, as for most of us, kindness is the only real lasting accomplishment.

Grandpa Brown just loved people, and so they were beautiful and loved people in their turn, who were then beautiful themselves. He makes me want to love people too: tend vines which may only flower and fruit for other generations. And hope they’re beautiful.
