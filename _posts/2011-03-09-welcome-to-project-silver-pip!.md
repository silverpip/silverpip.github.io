        I simply forget to notice the beautifulness around me every day. My life is shot through by the most heartbreakingly lovely people, moments, even objects I could dare to dream of. Glory shimmers just beyond my peripheral vision because I do not Stop. and Look at it. and Mull it over quietly.

  As I resurface from a year of K12 burnout and a tenacious, if not severe, bout of postpartum depression, I find myself arriving on the doorstep of Ash Wednesday. And so for these forty days I am going to practice. Practice mindfulness. Practice gratitude. Practice stopping and looking. At least once in a while. And every day I am going to write here something tiny I have noticed in the midst of the ordinary: beautiful, and silver, and maybe even shiny. I am going to count silver pips.
