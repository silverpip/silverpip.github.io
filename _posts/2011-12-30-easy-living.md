With Steven out of town, I thought we’d take things easy around here. No wake-up times, no math, and everyone could take as long as they wanted in the shower.

Returning from a quick bagel run this morning (groceries not being “easy”) I found a soaked teen and pre-teen desperately plying vise grips on an ice-cold shower.

Jack and Peter had reopened an old water-prank exchange in my absence, somehow breaking the bathtub tap so it couldn’t turn off.

We all very soberly munched bagels to the tune of rushing waterfalls and whirling cataracts. So fitting, considering just how rushing and whirling had been my chastisement. 

Unfortunately, housekeeping wasn’t a big part of “taking it easy” either, so the plumber joined our madhouse shortly after breakfast, gingerly stepping over toys and politely averting his eyes from yesterday’s muddy smears.

The boys were very, very good all afternoon.

And nobody took it easy.
