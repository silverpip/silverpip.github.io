A Sycamore Maple grows serenely sideways from a riverbank near my house, its great old trunk peely soft in patches of white and gray. Wide green leaves dangle just above the current, peacefully surveying a rush of flotsam and jetsam and little water birds. Every time I see this tree as I run over the bridge I get a little shiver of delight: it grows so grandly and unexpectedly, it is so dignified and so droll hanging there, huge, suspended in space.

Joyfully it brings to mind one of my very favorite psalms, Psalm 1 (which is a handy psalm to love since I get to read it every time I resolve to work through the whole book sequentially. As a bonifide flibberty-gibbet, I may never actually accomplish this, but Iâ€™ve read Psalm 1 a lot!)

_Blessed is the man that walks not in the counsel of the ungodly,__ nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of the scornful. _

_ But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law does he meditate day and night. _

_ And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that brings forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatever he does shall prosper. _

_Psalm 1:1-3_
