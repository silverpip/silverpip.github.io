        I am shocked and humbled every time I accidentally encounter otherness. To realize right down at the very heart of things that other people are not merely an extension of myself, or the same as me, is truly surprising every time. Even a little unsettling.

Tonight we spent some time at a church home group hearing bits of friends’ stories, important moments in their faith journeys. This sort of thing bewilders me with the glory of otherness. The people whom I joke with and talk to and feel I know, are so completely _not mine_.

It reminded me of another night, when in the course of a perfectly ordinary (and rather boring) meeting full of people I neither knew nor cared to know, a sense fell shatteringly upon me of the holy imminence of many souls gathered together– and_ I didn’t like it_. To tell the truth, it rather made me squirm. To keep back from the other, to presume sameness or better yet, not to think of them at all, is much more comfortable. It is a sort of spiritual coma I find myself living in most of the time.

I heard a friend say just this weekend, “You guys, it totally blows my mind to think that other people have feelings!”

I chuckled.

Then I stumbled across this quote at the bottom of another friend’s gmail account (yes, I actually do read those. &lt;blush&gt;): _“Love is the incredibly difficult realization that something other than oneself is real.” –Iris Murdoch _

I mused.

This is a mystery too great for me. When confronted by the piercing presence of the other, I feel I ought to be silent. And ask for the grace to remain with eyes open.
