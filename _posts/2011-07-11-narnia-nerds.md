         We are Narnia nerds (the books only, please; read properly in their original order, thank you very much.) Each one of our children carries the mark of some character from the Chronicles, either in their first or middle names. 

 You would think our children could recite the stories from memory by now, but alas! A funny thing happened one day that stopped Narnia zeal before it could really get started. 

 We were on a car trip, reaching for an audiobook to while away the hours. Jack, the oldest, had always enjoyed all things Narnia, and it never crossed our minds that any of the others might not. As he heard our choice of entertainment, Peter, the second, exclaimed in a burst of pent-up frustration, “I don’t want to listen to Narnia! I don’t like Narnia! I’m not like the rest of you, and I’M TIRED OF NARNIA!” 

 So we very quietly, with slightly raised eyebrows and careful spirits, put in a different audiobook and assured him that it was completely alright to like different sorts of things. We have tried to be quite respectful of his taste in literature ever since, and I have never once pushed Narnia on him again, though mildly recommending he give it another go now and then. 

 I admit, it has made my heart a bit sore through the years to think of my child growing up without the richness of those stories, but he is a different kid, and my job is not to make him like what I like. As if I could. 

 A couple days ago, he piped up again from the backseat, “I was thinking, we should read Narnia again. Maybe Jack could read it to us in bed.” You could have knocked me down with a feather. 

 And I feel perfectly happy tonight, snuggled up in Polly’s bed, my children gathered round. Jack’s voice brings us all through the wardrobe and there is a peaceful, listening look on Peter’s face. It is so good to be home.
