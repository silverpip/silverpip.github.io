        Nick cuddled up by Steven while he worked; playing so sweetly, so quietly, so… cutting Daddy’s hair with his new scissors…

After naps, Jack found an empty glue bottle and a broken white trail squeezed from the dining room, around the hall, and splashed up the stairs…

As we washed up dinner and settled in for a quiet evening, Polly emerged with huge swathes of her own hair missing. An oddly uneven mullet perched atop her head…

Two very short haircuts and a carpet cleaning later, we are considering a retinal scan security system for our pencil cupboard.

Even if Polly _is_ adorable in her new pixie cut.
