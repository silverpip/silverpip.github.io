 Short, snippy, and impossibly introverted for the past couple days, I have squandered shameful amounts of time lurking in corners, refusing my attention to needful things like fairy tales and finger rhymes. When this mood overcomes my better self, all life seems a bitter imposition and simple joys become mere weariness. Adding insult to injury, I have no clue to the cause, only a battle to win against it. 

 Steven very sweetly and wisely took himself off to bed early and left me to my book, a most fortunate collection of Chesterton. Amid pages of towering sanity one quote winked cheerily. I adore a candid challenge flung. 

 _Let no one flatter himself that he leaves his family life in search of art, or knowledge; he leaves it because he is fleeing from the baffling knowledge of humanity and from the impossible art of life. _

 _–G.K. Chesterton, “A Defence of Bores” _
