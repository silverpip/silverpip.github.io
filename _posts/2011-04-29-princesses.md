 Yes, Polly and I woke early to watch the royal wedding this morning, rather on a whim. I can’t believe how fun it was. The dress, the hats, the archbishop, the trees _inside_ Westminster Abbey, the boys’s choir: everything was just fabulous. Polly, dressed to the hilt in her own very special white lacey play dress, leaned over to me a few minutes in and whispered, awed, “_Mommy, she’s so pretty!_" 

 It all went downhill for her after that, since she couldn’t understand why the prince and the princess weren’t dancing. But she did tell everyone at preschool all about it, so the wedding must have made an impression, even without the longed-for dance. 

 All day, I found myself dreamily thinking about princesses. Although my snobby (and let’s be honest: slightly envious of her tiara) self whispers that I would almost certainly dislike the poor woman very much, I can’t help hoping she someday fulfills my dream of wearing her crown atop a red bus all the way to Harrod’s for tea.
