It turns out that the ban on home fireworks in Pennsylvania was lifted last year. Who knew?

All I can say is… WOW!

I have never before been to a private fireworks party, and it was fantastic. I know the boys will never, as long as they live, forget the wild rocket gone awry, whizzing in circles up a great round tree trunk, exploding into fiery red sparks among the leaves. Nor the echoing booms of The Big Ones, mingling with all our squeals and startled jumps. There were sparkler dances and Roman Candle spell castings, and one beautifully christened The Queen Mum’s Teeth. No professional display has ever satisfied me so deeply. 

We have a friend who chooses her surprise extravagances with unerring perfection, and always for small, casual, even off-handed gatherings of old friends. A giant three-tiered box of Godiva truffles wrapped in satin ribbon here, hundreds of dollars worth of home fireworks there. Rare, precious, and unexpected, some of the most brilliantly luxurious moments of my life have been in her living room or front yard.

The joy of that kind of cost being poured out over my unworthy self is humbling, and dignifying, and exquisitely humanizing.

Thank you, Sarah Windsor.
