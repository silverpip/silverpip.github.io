        Cold night air on our drowsy faces and carols in the car all the way to midnight mass started everything off just right. And it only got better: quietly, gladly celebrating our Lord’s birth together with twinkly-winkly lights and sung liturgy.

Christmas morning was just what Christmas morning ought to be. Short on sleep and long on joy; distilled family. And then naps. Beautiful naps on the couch, restful even with the intermittent poking of a two-year-old.

I woke from my Christmas nap to find figgy pudding steaming on the stove and a cup (or more) of good cheer mulling in the crock. Steven in the kitchen, kids absorbed in new toys: peace on earth and good will toward men. Even Nick went to sleep sweetly at the very end, worn out at last (and unable to wrest Polly’s toys from her fist.)

It was a lovely Christmas.
