<h2>Small Opportunities</h2><p></p><p>Steven came riding home off the bike path with a baby snapping turtle in tow. This is something I adore about him: his boundless enthusiasm for life, his endless curiosity, his unflagging energy for investigation. However hard his day, at the end of it Steven always has it in him to snatch at small opportunities. I learn so much from him, and not just about local wildlife.</p><p>Of course, we put the very adorable turtle right back where Steven found him, since this is one baby we donâ€™t need to raise into a hulking 75 lb monster who bites our fingers off.</p></article>
