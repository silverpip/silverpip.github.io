 My childhood summers were split between mouthing silly sounds into the fan and swimming at the community pool. Those were long, languorous hours full of nothing at all, and I am very grateful for them. 

 I practiced flips in the shallow end all afternoon. Around and around until my lungs were bursting and I lost all sense of up or down, I’d head toward sunlight and break into dry air, gasping and dizzy and perfectly happy. Forwards, backwards, sideways: it was a purely personal accomplishment. 

 I can’t do so many flips these days. I get too seasick, too quickly. But the childhood joy of it still holds, even as an old lady. Sunlight seen spinning through water, bubbles every which way, the dizzy rush and the breaking surface. 

 I always do a flip or two before I leave the pool.
