 I have a friend, steady as a rock, whom I have treasured since middle school. Once in a while, we’re even on the same continent. 

 And I tell you what, this life stage of mothering is the toughest yet as far as friendship goes. By the time all our stars align (not to mention our children’s), I’m so sleepy I can hardly put two sentences together, much less an interesting conversation with another mind. 

 I’m just so grateful to know that if she’s been around this long, over such distances– both physical and experiential– then she’ll still be when our kids are grown and we pull words together and live deeply artistic lives again. 

 Until then, we can hand out wet wipes and kiss boo-boos side by side. Once in a while. When we’re on the same continent.
