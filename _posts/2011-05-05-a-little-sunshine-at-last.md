         Weather has a truly startling impact on all our moods. 

 To bask for hours in the glinting sunshine, chasing friends in vaguely organized games of tag, flopping onto little bellies in the sweet grass, climbing into the spreading maple trees to find safe perches amidst fresh ruffley leaves, after weeks and weeks of rainy confinement: this is rapture.. And to watch my children do these things for hours, so brimful of laughing, happy games they have not one argument or whining moment (that I could see) between themselves: this is ecstasy. 

 The whole tableau spread before me at the park was unreal, some watercolor illustration come magically to life from the pages of an old-fashioned anthology of childrenâ€™s poetry, complete with ruddy cheeks and wind-rifled hair (though always excepting the many, many pairs of ripped jeans flashing past.) 

 Today it is easy to call myself a blessed woman.
