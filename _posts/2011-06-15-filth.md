         Someone small spilled a strawberry smoothie over our couch on Monday evening. Today I realized it is still there, pink and crusty and waiting, like a pink crusty waiting thing with no initiative, no get-up-and-go, no self motivation at all. Lying there, looking up at me, saying “Well? And when are you going to get around to _me_?" 

 I seem to be without initiative myself. We have all simply started sitting on it now. It’s a slippery slope, I know. Soon we’ll be eating cereal out of measuring cups for lack of clean dishes (handy handles) and slipping on discarded banana peels– oh wait, there’s one right over there! But I just can’t get up the gumption tonight.
