         I spent Saturday in a dream. Steven shooed me out early and I wandered barefoot under twisty, spreading trees all over campus, alone with Bach (heâ€™s definitely my favorite.) A sudden downpour caught me breathless and running for shelter. Curling up a few wet moments later into brown leather and a private alcove on the eleventh floor of the library, I could not have named a deeper peace. It was my happy place. 

 To lose myself in books without reference to clocks or outside demands is the greatest luxury I have ever known, and I left that hidey-hole hours later in a state of perfect emotional rest and limp mental exhaustion. 

 A much nicer, saner woman emerged from that library than went in.
