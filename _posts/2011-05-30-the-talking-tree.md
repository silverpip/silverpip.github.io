         In our cityâ€™s rose garden, a great weeping beech trails its leaves along a spot of grass, cocooning anyone who comes to play in a private world of curving gray branches and shady coolness. Children climb into its airy cradles all around to chat, and play, and dream. 

 I hear tell of an old man who frequents this garden, loving to sit sometimes for a moment on the bench nearby, listening. He calls it the Talking Tree. In it there are always little voices calling to one another, disembodied amidst the leaves, chatting, chatting.
