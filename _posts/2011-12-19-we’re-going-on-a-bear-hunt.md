        With each new toddler comes fresh perspective on Helen Oxenbury’s wonderful “Bear Hunt”. I love it. Love all the wandering together. Love the look on the father’s face as his baby explores mud with her toes. Love the oldest sister’s tenderness in gathering small sibling’s shoes. Love the impulsiveness which remembered neither mittens nor sandwiches. Love the exploring, and the freedom, and the shock of success at the very end.

But over the years, in all the many moods I’ve chanted it, two questions loom: Why did they go, and why did they keep going? (Without so much as a coat between them!)

This afternoon, midway between being slapped across the cheek by a whip thin branch and snagged from behind by a briar, I understood in a thunderclap of insight exactly how the “Bear Hunt” family found themselves in such a predicament.

Gnawed trails of woodland wreckage along our neighborhood hiking path hinted at beavers so persuasively, we just dropped everything to find one. The hunt led us through similarly disparate terrain, in similarly impromptu outerwear, with a similarly low chance of success. And the shocking sight of an actual little beaver house, snugly tucked up in brown marsh grass with a cheery, industrious logging path leading up to its front door, sent us home victorious: a rough and ragged band of intrepid explorers.

This bear hunt life is exactly right.

Because it’s such a beautiful day.  
 And we’re not scared.
