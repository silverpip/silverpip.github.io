         I know this is weird and all, but what really brought me joy and life today was… going to confession. 

 When Steven and I first were talking about becoming Catholic, I would lay out some objections, and he would say, “ …but you could go to confession…” like it was some sort of funny ecclessial carrot. Which, actually, it was. 

 I realized how deeply I needed a confessor when I caught myself confessing to perfect strangers on the playground. “Sometimes I am such a mean person.” Not seeking absolution or anything, I just cannot let people think I am better than I actually am. It makes me feel dirty. But coming clean makes them feel awkward. 

 So I guess that’s what the confessional’s for. A space for our awkwardness. Because gosh, yeah, it’s awkward. But when I enter that space and lay it all out, and find grace there instead of judgement, and hope instead of punishment, and practical wisdom instead of torturous guilt, I am not only surprised every single time, I am made able to start fresh again, even to allow people to think I’m better than I really am on that playground if that’s what they need. 

 Absolution is my medicinal drug of choice.
