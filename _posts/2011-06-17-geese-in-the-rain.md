         We travelled down to our children’s science center this hot and steamy afternoon expressly to climb into giant yellow diggers and admire their wheels. And they were impressive. But after a few minutes we found ourselves eschewing the queues and wandering closer and closer to the river, dabbling in small fountains, hopping down concrete steps and collecting fallen goose feathers. Eventually the blessed rain fell, and there we were, sitting on mucky water steps, watching geese sail by silently, wet to the skin and content as could be. Even baby Nick was still for a moment. 

 Those diggers just weren’t what we were interested in after all.
