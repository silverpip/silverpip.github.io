Today was Jack’s first day of work. Ever. (He’s volunteering at our local science center.) And as I dropped him off and watched those jaunty little shoulders, so dearly familiar, grow smaller and smaller against the huge front doors until finally disappearing inside, I felt a silent wail, part maternal pride and part mother’s lament well up in my breast. But life doesn’t stop, and there were naps to be on time for.

Driving home, listening to Charlotte’s Web, we all felt a little odd.

“Aren’t we waiting for Jack to hear the story?”

“No, no. He’s heard it before. And he has to go to to work now.”

Not waiting a story on someone puts them in a different category, the category previously belonging solely to Steven: busy with outside responsibilities, occupied with other things, adult. Certainly not one of the kids. We _always_ wait for _all_ the kids. Until today.

Will I ever get used to it: sending my children into the wide world to seek their fortunes?
