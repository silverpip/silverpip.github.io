        <div>Looking out with hollow eyes upon a world bleak with hail and sleet, I wondered what there was to this life business, anyway. At that moment, Thomas dumped a boxful of bendy straws all over the floor; Nick and Polly found an infinite number of uses for them. William began practicing with Steven’s didgeridoo, and announced his plan to make “Hot Diggetty!” the new expression of our household. Angst vanishes in the face of such glad burbling.</div>

<div>I couldn’t help myself. We baked snickerdoodles and stayed up late watching movies like The Kung Fu Emperor’s New Panda Groove.</div>

<div>Fair Aprille blushes down on us indoors today, that’s all.</div>
