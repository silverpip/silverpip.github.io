### Jack – Theater

Today’s quest was to see as many temples and monuments in one day as humanly possible, and I must say that we came very close. There were undying classics like the Parthenon. There were also some amazing ones that are less advertised.

One of my favorites was the Theater of Dionysus: essentially the birthplace of theater, it is extensively ruined. In the very middle was an elegant marble throne that was clearly reserved for whoever ranked highest in the audience. That means Pericles, Alexander, and who knows how many others watched from the very seat I was inches away from.

It has been a very fulfilling three days in the capital, and I can’t wait to get to the sea.

  
  

### Ellie – Gratitude

The Parthenon lives up to its hype, amid crowds of tourists and a wonky tour group, it was breathtaking. Great vistas opening on every side, it’s perfect confidence of magnificent beauty is unmatched.

On the bus this morning, I read a bit of Against an Infinite Horizon by Ronald Rolheiser. It stuck with me throughout my day.

“To be a saint is to be motivated by gratitude, nothing more and nothing less… Saints, holy persons, are people who are grateful, people who see and receive everything as gift.”

It is so easy to be thankful on holiday. Every single moment is so obviously a gift, that gratitude simply spills from me. But what I really want, more even than continual holiday, is to learn the joy of this thankfulness in the daily grind.

Even where the bougainvillea grows less ecstatically.

### Steven – Heroes

Yesterday, I was telling Ellie that despite how much I have enjoyed my time in Greece, it lacked the personal connection that Israel had held for me. I remember quite vividly walking through the streets of the old city of Jerusalem, in a part of town that had been excavated down to the second temple period. As I stepped upon a huge paving stone in the middle of the walkway, it hit me like a ton of bricks: “Jesus stepped on this rock.”

Today, I was fortunate enough to have a similar experience here in Athens. Twice, in fact.

We were walking with our tour group up the hill toward the Parthenon, when in passing, our guide mentioned that over to the left was a rock called the Areopagus, where (according to the book of Acts) Paul once stood and preached Christianity for the very first time in Athens.

Now, Saint Paul and I have never really gotten along. I find his writing frustratingly opaque, and his words are all too often used in defense of theologies that I find utterly baffling. However, as a Christian struggling to live out my faith in an intellectual context that isn’t exactly friendly to it, that particular story has meant a lot to me.

After visiting the Parthenon museum, we headed off to see the Temple of Hephaestus. Along the way, there was a crumbled mess of ruins off the path to the left and, despite the onset of ancient-ruin-fatigue, I decided that we should go and check it out.

It was the School of the Philosophers.

Socrates. Plato. Aristotle. They had all been here. In this place, on these hills, walking past these temples. These men, whose works I have dissected and explained to bright young minds in so many classrooms, walked these same dusty paths and enjoyed the same breathtaking views of the sea that I had just been stunned by atop the Acropolis.

Athens, like Jerusalem, is a magical place. It makes words on a page profoundly real. My heroes have left their footprints here, and in the smallest of ways, I have made contact with them.

I now share this place with them and I will be forever changed by the experience.
