         It is the first day in our next parenting season, the dawn of an age. 

 Jack turned thirteen today, and Steven and I realized we have eighteen consecutive years of teenagers before us. 

 Participating in our childrenâ€™s growth to adulthood is an honor and a privilege: God be with us all.
