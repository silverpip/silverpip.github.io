         I love having friends who garden generously. And friends who have friends who garden generously. 

 My ideal version of myself, the one I like to picture as I pose for the occasional inner snapshot, is an effortless gardener, coaxing blooms and fruit from the toughest soil with my tender touch and Disney princess song. Reality is much more haphazard (like lots of other things about me) and the fruit is rather hit or miss. 

 So this most wonderful time of the year, when all the truly great gardeners bring bags of sunshine to my table, is nothing short of fabulous. Christmas in July. 

 Thank you.
