<h2>A First Communion Ditty</h2><p>While bringing out William’s first communion cake this afternoon, we realized none of us knew any good songs for the occasion. To correct such a gross oversight, Steven later composed this lovely little rhyme which we sang rousingly to the tune of <em>The Church’s One Foundation</em>. I think it’ll catch on.</p><p><em>Oh! William’s first communion,</em></p><p><em>It was so very splendid.</em></p><p><em>He wore a fancy coat and tie</em></p><p><em>Just like all the old men did.</em></p><p><em>He got to have the Body and Blood</em></p><p><em>Via transubstantiation.</em></p><p><em>And now he has the gift of grace,</em></p><p><em>Instead of hell-fire and damnation.</em></p><p><em>When everything was over</em></p><p><em>We got to have a party,</em></p><p><em>To celebrate our little Will</em></p><p><em>Who’s sweet and kind and smarty!</em></p></article>
