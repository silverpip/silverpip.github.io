         Steven came home this evening to find me in a puddle of panic over my computer, lost in a labyrinth of homeschooling advice and booklists. The internet is a scary place. What began as a bright-eyed search for some quick inspiration slid quickly into a deep conviction of personal incompetence. 

 Once I finished choking out my abject confession of absolute failure, Steven very kindly and patiently listed our assets, a few brilliant successes, and a ridiculously feasible plan for the homeschooling future which I could carry out in my sleep, or even with a few new babies, if need be. 

 That brought roses back to my cheeks, and a fresh resolve to be very, very wary about that insidious Internet.
