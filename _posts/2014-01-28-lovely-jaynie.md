        The first time I met Jaynie, I was a little nervous. Stephen was bringing his girlfriend over for dinner to introduce us, and I had no idea what to expect from the evening ahead. 

But from the moment she walked in my door, I fell to adoring her. The sweet way she had about helping, the happy dreamy look she would get in her eyes as she listened to her man chat, the flash of clever wit as she gently teased or disagreed. 

After dinner, we two sipped our tea together in one of the most comfortable first conversations I have ever had with anyone. Jaynie has a quiet way of putting people at their ease and drawing out their best sides. I have since seen her do this again and again, and I am always inspired. She did that for me then, and it turned out a wonderful evening and a treasured friendship. 

She is in every way a charming woman, and what is even rarer and more precious, a truly authentic one. 

And Stephen is a very lucky man.
