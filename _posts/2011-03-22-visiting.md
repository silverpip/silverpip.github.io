        I was honored this afternoon by a visit from a woman who is just beautifully and completely herself.

This is a woman who will stop and recite long, poignant passages of poetry to you on a busy sidewalk if she feels it pertinant (as, of course, it is.) She has soaked herself in love and words and meaning for so many years that all three simply tumble from her. She arrived at my door bearing banana bread, showered me with superb poetry anthologies culled from her own collection, and illuminated my heart with subtle and fascinating ideas about hope sprinkled casually with scriptural metaphor and literary allusion.

It is women like this, our mothers and our friendsâ€™ mothers, who show us the way to grow. They give me, at least, a lovely dream of aging. Which is good, since I just found my first curly gray hair.
