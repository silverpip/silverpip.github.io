Steven took me out for a quick walk tonight. Snowy branches still under white starlight were strange and lovely; we and the murmuring river alone in movement. Sliding over icy roads, plowing through high drifts all the way down to the park, wet feet, cold noses, and then just laughter.

For in this winter-bound city devoid of snow plows, the bike path is clear as a grandmaâ€™s kitchen floor. It is probably the only safe route anywhere in Columbus, if only you can get to it. 

Whoever is in charge of that path has my vote for school board, mayor, and president.
