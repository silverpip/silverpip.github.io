        The breeze had a nip in it today. A playful, flirty little nip to toss our hair and excite our hope, except perhaps for the three year old, who only needed to pee.

In yesterdayâ€™s oppressive heat I had brought a large watermelon home, the kind that sounds so beautifully hollow when you thump it in the bin next to the other watermelons, and despite the fact that today was really much better suited to hot buttered toast and steaming mugs of tea, we ate it all.

I think I could eat a whole watermellon by myself in a snow storm, and find it delicious.
