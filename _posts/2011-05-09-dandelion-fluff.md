 During a rather scattered Mother’s Day walk, the children made wishes and blew dandelion seeds to the four winds (as well as slogging through some unexpected bogs.) Suddenly Thomas bolted straight into the field, puff-balls pouring from his heels. 

 “Where are you going!? Come back!” 

 “I’m running through wishes!” he called in delight. 

 Later, we had our annual picnic of poetry and treats on lawn chairs to keep our ankles out of spring’s ubiquitous mud. A few real stunners of original composition rubbed elbows with the usual Shel Silverstein favorites, and there was plenty of pie and taffy for dessert. 

 That night, as baby Nick nursed his way into dreamland, I thought how full and happy I was. Usually, I hear of people giving their burdens and sufferings to Christ when those grow too heavy, but I felt compelled instead to lay my joy over his ample shoulders. I truly am not big enough to hold it all myself, it comes so thick and fast. I am running through wishes, and they blow in the wind behind me.
