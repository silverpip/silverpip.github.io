         _ “Does everyone here grow the way you do?” puffed Milo when he had caught up. _

 _ “Almost everyone,” replied Alec, and then he stopped a moment and thought. “Now and then, though, someone does begin to grow differently. Instead of down, his feet grow up to the sky. But we do our best to discourage awkward things like that." _

 _ "What happens to _them_?” insisted Milo. _

 _ “Oddly enough, they often grow ten times the size of everyone else,” said Alec thoughtfully, “and I’ve heard that they walk among the stars.”_ 

 _ –Norton Juster, __The Phantom Tollbooth_ 

 The strange birds, the ones the rest of us can’t quite manage, the people so odd they can’t even pretend to fit in, their true selves bursting out whatever _we_ do: those are often the great ones. They live in a larger world, and they walk among the stars. 

 This puts me in mind of Hans Christian Anderson, Vincent van Gogh, Ludwig von Beethoven, Albert Einstein, Dame Julian of Norwich, and the rest. If there were a “How to Live Well” handbook, this passage should be inscribed opposite the frontispiece, just under the title in teeny tiny gold lettering. 

 Next time I question why I’m homeschooling, I’ll just go back and read The Phantom Tollbooth once again.
