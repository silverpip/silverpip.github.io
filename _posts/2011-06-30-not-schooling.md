         People keep asking me whether I’m schooling the kids through the summer, and I keep telling them with the same wry grin that yes, I must, as we’ve taken too many winter holidays, though (insert reassuring head shake) we’re rather more relaxed about it than usual, since it is summertime after all. But who am I kidding? Only myself, I’m sure. Let me set the record straight: there is absolutely no school happening in my home this summer. 

 I never signed them up for any camps or activities or usual what-have-you’s, because we were going to be too busy doing school, of course. But every day there’s something more important to do, and while we’re having a lovely time with friends and pools and naps and card games and actually having some mental space to tidy up once in a while, the children are all keeping quite still and mousy quiet about _shhh_! school. 

 Surely they’re hoping I won’t think of it on my own, and they’re right. And we are all having such a beautiful, wonderful summer full of nothing at all. 

 I decided tonight to chalk this up to my own penetrating maternal wisdom into our collective need for down time. It’s all in how I market myself _to_ myself, isn’t it?
