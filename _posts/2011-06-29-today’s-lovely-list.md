 … oblations of summery scented California Baby bug spray around an evening campfire 

 … fresh-air sparkly eyes and sweaty heads in one final game of tag before leaving the cook-out 

 … s'more bits sticking out from the baby’s hair at unlikely angles 

 … irreplaceably great friends at every corner turned
