        <div><p>Maundy, as in mandatum, or mandate. I confess, celebration is not my first impulse when I consider the idea of commandment. But what a command. To love as He loves, to serve and suffer and bear each otherâ€™s burdens, to become broken bread and poured out wine for His world. This new command is too strong for me. I cannot look at it straight on as I cannot look into the sun; I sort of sidle up and stay close in a wobbly orbit, warming my heart but never quite throwing myself into the fire.</p><p>To be utterly transformed, to be changed by the fire into fire, this is what I want to desire always but so rarely do. When my children are tired or hungry or just emotional, when that stranger needs a listener or a sandwich, when I feel the proud, self-righteously wicked impulse to criticize (my most heart-wringing personal Waterloo), my orbit wobbles. Again I stop short of throwing myself into Love. How long will I flirt with the divine mercy?</p><p>Today I celebrate this commandment, celebrate the sun that does burn there for me to orbit. And I will hope and pray that someday soon I be made able to hurl myself in.</p></div>
