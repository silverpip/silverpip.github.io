_O why do you walk through the fields in gloves,_  
_ Missing so much and so much?_  
_ O fat white woman whom nobody loves,_  
_ Why do you walk through the fields in gloves,_  
_ When the grass is soft as the breast of doves_  
_  And shivering-sweet to the touch?_  
_ O why do you walk through the fields in gloves,_  
_ Missing so much and so much._

– Francis Cornford. ‘To A Fat Lady Seen From The Train’

After stumbling over this poem today, I immediately began peeling back layer after layer, very solemnly meditating on my own failures totake off my gloves, to throw myself into ever richer experiences of life, etc.Who should coming riding to my rescue but that true knight of damsels in poetic distress, G.K. Chesterton himself. It turns out he already answered Ms. Cornford quite neatly.

_Why do you rush through the fields in trains,_  
_ Guessing so much and so much._  
_ Why do you flash through the flowery meads,_  
_ Fat-head poet that nobody reads;_  
_ And why do you know such a frightful lot_  
_ About people in gloves and such?_

 – G.K. Chesterton, 'The Fat White Woman Speaks’
