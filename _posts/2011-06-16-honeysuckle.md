 I confess, I have dreamed since girlhood of a home with honeysuckle overgrowing some part of it. Which part was optional. What exactly honeysuckle looked like, smelled like, grew like, was also optional since the stories I read assumed its necessary role, but were rather vague on particulars. All I knew was that honeysuckle was a mandatory part of any worthy setting for a heroine, at some point during her madcap adventure of a life. 

 As it turns out, honeysuckle is the outrageously bushy plant topping a chain link fence beside my house, sending out wicked runners to lie in wait along the ground for little feet to toddle past and be tripped. I discovered this as summer began and an incandescently beautiful fairy tale scent filled my entire yard. 

 The honeysuckle is integral to the heroineâ€™s plot. Of that I am convinced. But whether fighting on the side of good or evil, well, that depends on the honeysuckle.
