         The villagey (as in, sort of in a village) homestead my brothers and sister and I bring our families home to is sold. Tonight was the last chat on the back steps while cousins ran amuck. Tomorrow my mother will help me take cuttings of a few cherished plants to nurture, hopefully, in a new garden. Soon boxes will fill up the floors we always skated on in our socks, and then my parents will lock the door behind them. And that will be that. Forever. In the fall, if I work up the guts, I will knock on a front door opened by strangers and ask if I may collect a few seeds from the Japanese Maple we planted many years ago, special to us for deeply human reasons they will never know and I will never share for awkwardness, and everything will be stiff and uncomfortable until I drive away again. 

 The walls around me become a cup to hold my memories, a chalice for the life poured out. If _now_ is all there is, and the future nonexistent, then the past is gone and tenuously banked by my senses. I entrust memories to their unreliable keeping. The house, though, keeps remembrance secure, and it is grief to leave those safe vaults forever. 

 But the next adventure waits just around the corner for us all; I will never get to see it if I hang back. I know, in a gameshow, I would be the one to cheerfully lose my fortune for the chance to see what was behind curtain number one. Every time.
