         This is the week of old friends. The calendar squares look like a timeline in my memoirs, each era represented by an important person from that time. They come from overseas or from far-flung states, stopping for a night and a morning, an oasis of food and sleep on their cross-country road trip. 

 Each comes through my unfamiliar door, bringing children I haven’t met or seen for years, their faces travel-lined and very, very dear. Their presence here, the renewal of past conversations and the taking up of new ones, the checking in on each other’s journeying; all this is deeply comforting as a link of continuity between past and present. The future looks less like a howling unknown when glimpses of such friends are caught in it. 

 We are a nomadic people of small family units. Instead of following the herds as a community together, we pack up our little tents alone and set off to seek our fortunes, to find meaningful work, to realize dreams or chase them. And then we see each other again. Briefly. Now and then. 

 This brief contact reassures me that I am not at sea alone. I may be adrift, but I am adrift in good company.
