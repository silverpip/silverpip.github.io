        _The driver bowed and took my things._

_He wore a mackintosh and wings._

_He wore a mackintosh and boots_

_the tender green of onion shoots,_

_and on his cap, in dappled green,_

_was “Blake’s Celestial Limousine.”_

_My suitcases began to purr._

_“Your luggage is excessive, sir._

_All luggage must be carried flat_

_and worn discreetly on your hat_

_or served with mustard on a bun.”_

_Alarmed, I said I hadn’t one._

_My suitcases, my fondest hopes_

_grew small and pale as envelopes._

_“Now all aboard and all at ease_

_I only carry whom I please.”_

_Uneasily I stepped inside_

_and found the seats so green and wide,_

_the grass so soft, the view so far_

_it scarcely could be called a car,_

_rather a wish that only flew_

_when I climbed in and found it true._

–_Blake’s Wonderful Car Delivers Us Wonderfully Well from __William Blake’s Inn__ by Nancy Willard_

I was enjoying this tonight with my children in a sing-song, nonsensical, dream sequence sort of a way when suddenly a line jumped out and exploded the entire poem.

_My suitcases, my fondest hopes_

_grew small and pale as envelopes._

I went on and finished rather dazedly, in that manner which comes over me when the transcendent world is crashing in on this one and I am struggling to sort the two out. Once I had the last lines I knew.

_rather a wish that only flew_

_when I climbed in and found it true._

It is Augustine’s “faith seeking understanding” all over again, though rather more appealing to my personal aesthetic.

This poem explains just exactly how I feel about the process of giving myself over to divine providence, about this life’s journey of self-transcendence. The absurdity, hesitation, confusion, mystery, wrenching, lightness, and unexpected fulfillment all spun together inseparably, hilariously.

The author might be shocked and horrified that I read these sorts of things into her poem, I wouldn’t know. But I am gratified beyond reason to hear someone put her own words to an experience too complex for mine, even if she had no intention of doing so.
