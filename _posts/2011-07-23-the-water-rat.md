         _“Nice? It’s the _only_ thing,” said the water rat solemnly, as he leant forward for his stroke. “Believe me, my friend, there is _nothing_– absolutely nothing– half so much worth doing as simply messing about it boats. Simply messing,” he went on dreamily: “messing– about– in– boats; messing–”_ 

 _–The Wind in the Willows, Kenneth Grahame_ 

 There is a small island in a small river in a small wood, in which we sometimes walk. The just-out-of-reach-ness of this island has grown upon our children’s imaginations over time until flowering into a passion of longing this morning. “Do you think we could _ever_ get there to explore!?" 

 So we hauled out Grandpa’s inflatable rowboat armada and had ourselves a regular adventure down the Olentangy River. It was great fun, despite the cranky toddler and smelly mud (perhaps partly _because_ of the smelly mud.) I love the way a river feels different in its middle; strange and faerie. And so quiet (except for the toddler.) Only ten feet from a familiar bank, but a completely new country. 

 Upon reaching our longed-for wild island, we discovered an established homeless camp and high-tailed it back to the boats. So much for uncharted Ohio; we went to the pool.
