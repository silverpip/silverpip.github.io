 What began for me as a Lenten discipline of attentiveness has grown into a source of life. I really enjoy writing Silverpip, and it does help me to notice the beautiful all around. For whatever reason, I’m far less likely to spiral down into morbid self-pity or muddled sadness on those most moody days if I have this focus to bring me up short. So for now, I’ll keep Silverpip and see how it goes.
