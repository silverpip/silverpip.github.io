        _I wake in the morning early, _  
_ And always the very first thing,_  
_ I poke out my head and I sit up in bed,_  
_ And I sing, and I sing, and I sing._  
_ –Singing Time, by Rose Fyleman_

On the mornings when baby Nick wakes singing, life is less apt to look a howling wilderness.

His little voice floats sweetly through the curtain between our “rooms.” My eyelids flutter open disconsolately, and I make my morning choice to get up and begin feeding people. Still in a stumbly stupor, yes. Still an inward groan at the day ahead, yes. But standing on barren steppes with a chill wind blowing, not so much.

Life looks more like gray dawn rising, a single ray of sunshine shooting clear. A promise of good things.

I need those baby songs.
