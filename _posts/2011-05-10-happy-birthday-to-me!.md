 Coffee and chocolate croissants for breakfast is such a very good way to begin my 36th year, especially when eaten out under the trees. 

 I had no plan for the afternoon, but an unexpected party converged on my house and lingered lovingly until supper. It was a wonderful, crazy, quite-by-accident bunch of 14 children in various stages of napping, princess twirling, and button mashing, and their moms– dear friends– who made my day more special than I could have planned for on my own. And none of them even knew about my birthday. I hugged the secret, enjoying my unsolicited surprise party. How often does that happen? 

 …and now a quiet evening to come, curled up with my true love, drinking mojitos, watching a girl movie. And how often does that happen!?
