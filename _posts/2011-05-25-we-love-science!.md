         “Science Day” at our local waterpark means super cheap admission for large homeschool families and their very helpful grandparents (and lots of mentos n'coke). Yaaaay! 

 Jack and Peter raised their hands tremulously as the swinging pirate ship tipped them vertically, and looked as though they were going to be sick. Later they took great delight in my screams of terror while we plummeted into a giant funnel. 

 During an especially frenzied episode of bumper cars, I looked over my shoulder and saw William, spinning and spinning, a beatific mixture of glee and bliss shining from his face. 

 We were so wet, and so excited, and having so much fun together, that by the time we thought to get around to the science part, all three booths had packed up and gone home. So we rode the roller coaster instead…in a continuous loop nine times until the operator said he had to close it up. Steven and I sat in the back and smooched for an entire loop, which I can’t recommend as it spoils both the roller coaster and the smooching simultaneously. 

 Early on, Thomas told us, “I _love_ this day!” After some light rafting, he divulged that it was a better day even than his last birthday. Soon, it had become the “best day in my entire life”, followed a few slides and a wave pool later by the ultimate, “Today is better than _Christmas_!” When he could no longer make it up any more tall stairs, he explained, “It’s only my legs, Daddy. It’s not _me_ that’s tired." 

 I guess they had fun doing science.
