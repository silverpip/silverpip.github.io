Thomas and I spent an evening curled up together under a blanket with _Bearskin_, while Jack chuckled over limericks in the opposite chair. Our agreed favorite:

_There was an Old Man on a hill,_

_Who seldom if ever stood still;_

_He ran up and down,_

_In his grandmother’s gown,_

_Which adorned that Old Man on a hill._

_–Edward Lear_

Illness on the cusp of spring extends the winter just long enough to feel we are draining its dregs, accepting every last drop of fireside joy it has to offer.

We have been coughing and wheezing and feverish one after another for a couple of weeks now, while the world outside thaws and little green shoots peek up, and every bit of us wants to cast off this hibernation we have endured for months. Instead we nap and measure out meds for each other and tell all those more fortunate that no, we would love to come out and play, but cannot.

Tonight the books and the blankets and the good company reminded me of that autumny longing which comes around so sharply every year, and how very much I will need all this again. These things so homey and deliciously anticipated by my sun-sated September self are being wrapped up tenderly now and placed upon my inside shelves. Down comforters and chicken soup with wide egg noodles, bookish evenings all together in the livingroom, babies in footie pyjamas.
