        A backyard shed assembled, small retaining wall dug out and rebuilt, stepping stones placed, firewood stacked, and all eight of us (ten if you count the grandparents) merrily marinated in glorious mud! Forgive me if I lean just a moment longer on my hoe.

Of course, Kipling has something perfectly lyrical (and fortunately not wicked or imperialistic) to say on topic. It went looping through my mind all afternoon:

_The camel’s hump is an ugly lump_

_Which well you may see at the Zoo;_

_But uglier yet is the hump we get_

_From having too little to do._

_Kiddies and grown-ups too-oo-oo,_

_If we haven’t enough to do-oo-oo,_

_We get the hump-_

_Cameelious hump-_

_The hump that is black and blue!_

_We climb out of bed with a frouzly head,_

_And a snarly-yarly voice._

_We shiver and scowl and we grunt and we growl_

_At our bath and our boots and our toys;_

_And there ought to be a corner for me_

_(And I know there is one for you)_

_When we get the hump-_

_Cameelious hump-_

_The hump that is black and blue!_

_The cure for this ill is not to sit still,_

_Or frowst with a book by the fire;_

_But to take a large hoe and a shovel also,_

_And dig till you gently perspire;_

_And then you will find that the sun and the wind,_

_And the Djinn of the Garden too,_

_Have lifted the hump-_

_The horrible hump-_

_The hump that is black and blue!_

_I get it as well as you-oo-oo-_

_If I haven’t enough to do-oo-oo!_

_We all get hump-_

_Cameelious hump-_

_Kiddies and grown-ups too!_

_–The Camel’s Hump by Rudyard Kipling_
