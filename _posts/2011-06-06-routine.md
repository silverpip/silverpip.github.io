 It is the small routines, the liturgies of my day, which form me. Those little duties, performed well or… often not so well, make me who I am. Washing my daughter’s hair gently. Turning out the bedroom light with a sweet-voiced goodnight. Making room graciously at the kitchen counter when my son asks if he can help with dinner. Sitting patiently with a cuddly baby when I hear a thousand urgent demands hammering in my head. Lavishing my attention on the teller when a story goes long. 

 These are my true battlegrounds. I limp bleeding from the field each night, wounds gaping. By sunrise, I am stitched up and thrust back out to the front. And some days, I wound a few demons myself. And I take ground, so slowly. A little gentler here, a bit kinder there. One time I was patient. 

 Sometimes I wish St. George would show up and slay a few for me. But it seems I’m not the lady in the tower. I’m the shield maiden down below.
