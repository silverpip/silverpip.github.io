        _All shall be well, and all shall be well, and all manner of thing shall be well. – Dame Julian of Norwich_

My house is a hurricane of dishes and misplaced clutter and mysterious crud crawling from corners. My children are absolutely undirected, there is a huge shed project starting in the backyard, and nothing but frozen beef and wilted asparagus to eat. Nap schedules are in disarray so babies are crying. Polly has spilled ice-water all over the couch (and ourselves) so we are crying.

Our family celebrated so many wonderful things in the past three weeks that everyday living fell by the wayside. Now I am fixating on neglected priorities, I am not breathing deeply, and I am certainly not stopping to drink enough water.

But,

_Let nothing disturb you,_

_Let nothing frighten you,_

_All things pass away:_

_God never changes._

_Patience obtains all things._

_He who has God_

_Finds he lacks nothing;_

_God alone suffices._

_–Teresa of Avila_

I’m not really feeling it. I’ll just have to take Teresa’s word for it, and go from there.
