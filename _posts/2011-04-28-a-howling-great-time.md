         It’s monsoon season here in Ohio. I hadn’t realized that Ohio _had _a monsoon season, but there you are. Pretty soon Parks and Rec will be adding a new rainforest themed metro park and it will be official. 

 This afternoon, we grabbed a quick twenty minutes between drizzles and ran around the normally dignified Rose Garden like howling Celtic warriors (at least the boys did.) Polly took a demure little pee under cover of some holly and then spun round the fountain’s edge until slipping _splash_ into its murky basin. Then we (and anyone else taking a romantic stroll) heard what howling could be, when truly moved by the spirit. Nick quietly lost a shoe amongst some violets, and Steven and I decided we were ready for some good old-fashioned indoor fun. 

 Really, a mere quarter hour adventure can add great spice to life.
