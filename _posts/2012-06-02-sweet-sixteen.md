        Sixteen years ago, Steven and I were married. Now our marriage is ready to get a driver’s license and go!

Down dusty country lanes arched by green boughs; off-road into ditches deep with the mud of slow-trickling springs: the tires can take it. Away onto freeways, straight as ploughed furrows through cornfields in the heartland, past soft-eyed cattle further west; a road trip to learn the ways of on ramps and nervy lane changes. Let’s take our time and stop at a few mountains along the way. And when we get back home at last, you can be sure we’ll know how to drive.

With plenty of loud, happy children in the back seat.
