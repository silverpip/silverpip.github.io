<h2>On Being Easily Lost and Found</h2><p><em>“If you become a crocus in a hidden garden,” said his mother, “I will be a gardener. And I will find you.” – Margaret Wise Brown, The Runaway Bunny</em></p><p><em><br/></em></p><p>When I walk the paths of our public Children’s Garden during summertime, I get lost in leafy nooks and behind little stone fountains. One arbor leads off this way and another leads that way and before I know it I am standing circled by 6 wild garden sprites (who used to be children) puzzling over the Way Out.</p><p>But in March, branching twigs and unadorned metalwork mark my path. Hydrangea skeletons quiver on their long gray stalks. I see the whole garden spread out before me like a map drawn on a napkin by a good friend over coffee. I don’t even have to find my way: it is already found for me.</p></article>
