        My first run in nine months was today, and of course I felt I might die. And not just because of the ice, which is once again all over the bike path. Sadly, that sort of thing, just like all sorts of things, requires maintenance. I retract my vote for its keepers.

But this feeling of bursting lungs and metallic tongue, this vague unfounded worry over heart rate, and these leaden legs refusing to pick up their pace, cannot touch me as they could on my very first run of all. Because now I know they will pass in a shockingly short time and leave me once again in charge of my body. All I have to do is keep running. It is enough.

I find myself hoping maybe prayer is the same way. All this fractured flailing about in shadow and quick glimpses of dappled light may one day center and focus and come together, if only I keep on.

Abraham of the Desert told his niece Maria that the keeping on getting up again was the important bit. Which makes him _my_ Desert Father, for sure.
