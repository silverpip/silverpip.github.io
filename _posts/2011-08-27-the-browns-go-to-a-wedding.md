         Ah, weddings. I love weddings. A wedding is an incarnation of hope and faith in our ability to keep our promises. 

 Thomas Howard (that dear darling pince-nezzed gentleman) wrote somewhere of our steady keeping of each other. I am the priestess of _this_ sacred grove; you are the priest of _this_ woodland temple. We pour ourselves out in love and do not wander aimlessly from a vocation given. 

 That we can stand together and witness such life-bearing promises is a staggerment of joy, and I am swept up in it every time.
