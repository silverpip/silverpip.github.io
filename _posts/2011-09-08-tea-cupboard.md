My tea cupboard is miraculous. It looks like anyone else’s tea cupboard, just a regular kitchen shelf full of anything I might need to make a quick pot. It’s so unassuming, in fact, I never realized until today how much I love it.

Everything else about my physical space must be organized, reordered, maintained. A floor is vacuumed only to be strewn afresh. A bookshelf is thinned only to be jammed again. These tasks belong rightly to balance and harmony.

But to find one teeny tiny corner which stays tidy _all by itself_ feels a pure gift. Anything I want for that one piece of life called “making tea” is at my fingertips. No searching under other kitchen tools. Nothing has wandered, or been wandered with. The boxes are all the same size so they stack without toppling. Brewing tea never makes me tense.

It is a lyrical cupboard.
