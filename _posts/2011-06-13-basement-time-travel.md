I’ve been sifting through boxes all afternoon, uncovering honeymoon photos and newborn hospital bracelets between appliance manuals and old grocery lists. All the sepia toned sweetness obscuring my clarity right now has me feeling quite sentimental. We summoned children down to the basement periodically, calling out “Do you remember… Look at when your… can you believe how chubby…?"

All those early years, first few babies, and youthful faces stare back at me from photographs as from a different life. The distance seems farther, and much mistier than I remember in my own head. Why should a mere photo create such a feeling of discontinuity?

It is similar to how I imagine time travel. Incongruous, disorienting, and completely wonderful. Also, it renders me absurdly fatuous if done too frequently.

I recommend most highly Connie Willis’ _To Say Nothing of the Dog_ to anyone in need of some great, great fiction on that particular topic, or really on any topic at all.
