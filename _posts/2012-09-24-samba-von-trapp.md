While Maria is busy being mortally offended by the Captain’s whistle, I am usually thinking, “That’s a _fantastic_ idea…”

I treated myself to a samba whistle last week. I love it: each child has a special call.

I do feel a bit self-conscious in public (admit: you would also stare, startled, and wonder a few mildly judgmental thoughts if your pleasant family park outing were shattered by a lunatic mother’s whistling. I’m sure _I_ would.)

But privately, it is miraculous. The pitter-patter of answering feet without the strain of successively louder shouting is music.

When dinner is ready I don’t have to chase everyone down until it’s stone cold and I’m red in the face. If the trash needs to go out, I don’t have to abandon lunch prep to search out the miscreant who forgot to empty it the night before.

It is honey in my tea.

But I draw the line at marching.
