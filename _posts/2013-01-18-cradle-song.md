        _THE angels are stooping_

_Above your bed;_

_They weary of trooping_

_With the whimpering dead._

_God’s laughing in Heaven_

_To see you so good;_

_The Sailing Seven_

_Are gay with His mood._

_I sigh that kiss you,_

_For I must own_

_That I shall miss you_

_When you have grown._

_– “_A Cradle Song”_by William Butler Yeats_



New babies are magical. There can be nothing sweeter. And in the midst of enchantment, I can’t help a twinge of melancholy knowing this time is so short.

I once answered a nostalgic old lady who wondered if I “didn’t wish they could stay little forever?” with “Oh, no! None of us would ever get any sleep!”

She was rather shocked.

Still, I will miss him quite a lot when he is grown.
