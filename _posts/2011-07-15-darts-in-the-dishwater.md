         I almost had all my dishes done, I promise. Nerf darts whizzed about my ears. Soldiers from either side sallied and regrouped. I was Cookie, a military camp cook in the contested war zone, staying at my post, getting the job done. All that was missing was a MASH theme song and clip-clip of helicopters in the distance. 

 Once the darts started landing in my dishwater, I was through. Being shot at directly is a different matter. I grabbed my pistol and loaded six darts, spun the barrel, and the rest is historyâ€¦ except those dishes.
