         I am not one of those lucky ladies whose hair flows in effortless cascading waves of gleaming silken beauty. Mine requires muscle, and focus, and blacksmithing forges. But Steven adores it so much once it’s come from the forge, I haven’t had the heart to refuse him. This morning, through his recent neo-monasticism, Steven attained enlightenment and rendered me speechless with an announcement of hair-length renunciation. Thank the Lord in heaven! 

 We nervously zipped out the Flowbee and vacuumed that swishy, sweaty mess right off my head. I grabbed another leftover birthday brownie for good luck and hopped in the shower. A few more brownies and some texture creme later, I was a new woman surprised to be feeling like her old (young) self again with silly, quirky, untamable locks. 

 Oh lovely light coolness round my neck. 

 Oh sweet, sweet simplicity.
