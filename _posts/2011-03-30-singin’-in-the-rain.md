        This morning I began the drive to preschool fuddleheaded and silent,   
doing my job. Polly chatted blithely on, and an awareness dawned upon   
me that I was not giving this moment my personal best. But that best   
was definitely not up to the level of cheerful chatting. So I started   
to sing. Just little preschool songs, you know, about spiders and   
twinkly stars and workin’ on the railroad. The kind of songs we’ve   
sung together so often we both know where to insert all the silly   
sounds and there’s almost no real effort involved. Polly’s sweet little voice chimed right in, and Nick started dancing   
like he was at a nightclub. By the time we pulled into the parking   
lot, all the bleary thoughts had simply melted away, and we three were   
having the most fabulous time together. 

 I remember reading that Mother Theresa taught all her nuns to smile at   
people, that the smiling itself was hugely important and I was   
thoughtful. Later I learned that this injunction came from the midst   
of an internal landscape of doubt and suffering, and I was deeply   
moved.  Singing with my children in the car, offering up to them the few   
scattered shreds of my morning self: is it sort of, a little bit,   
maybe kind of like smiling with those who cannot smile for themselves?   
Will it at least lead me there one day?
