         The restorative effects of a popsicle are miraculous. 

 Two children sobbed in my arms after bumping heads, another twisted his ankle on the trampoline, and yet one more was involved in a mysterious slip-n-slide accident. I heard the early stages of a fight brewing somewhere behind me. The evening was turning into a circus of tradgedy. 

 Just when it seemed all was lost, Steven showed up with a box of Popsicles, and sadness vanished like mist at sunrise, every tear wiped from our eyes and forgotten in a blink and a cheer. 

 Weeping may last for a night, but joy comes in the morning. Have a popsicle.
