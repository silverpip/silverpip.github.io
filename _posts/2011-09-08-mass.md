        The last thing I felt in the mood for tonight was the bishop’s special mass for homeschooling families. Everything made me irritable: it was raining, I had to put on a skirt, Peter couldn’t find his shoes and had to wear Jack’s…

I waited foggily in my pew until the processional began. A swinging censor filled the cathedral with fragrant clouds of frankincense and with a jolt I suddenly remembered the one who my heart loves. Waves of restfulness rolled away the fog, making room for grateful contentment.

Peter’s oversized shoes flapped on the stone floor as he walked up for communion. It was music to my ears, my sense of humour restored.

Sometimes I just have to show up.
