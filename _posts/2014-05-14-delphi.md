### Jack – Close Encounters, Part I

Today was a day of close encounters. We got up early in the morning and had a hurried breakfast, because we knew that the tour bus left for Delphi at 8:00 am. After obtaining the location of the tour agency, we set off on a brisk walk across Athens. At EXACTLY 8:00, PRECISELY 20 minutes after heading out, we arrived at a small row of shops.

But there was no bus.

Or bus stop.

After looking around and waiting for a bit, we decided to go to the locals for assistance. The helpful man in the tire shop kindly pointed out the tour agency right next door, and said to go to the fourth floor. We dutifully climbed the stairs and searched the level, but all we found were some locked, seemingly empty offices.

After descending again, mom used previously mentioned tire man’s phone to call the building number. A wonderful man informed us that the bus had come to pick us up at our hotel, missed us, and kept going around collecting people. He called the bus driver, who came back and we went safely on our way.

  
  

### Ellie – Lovely People, Part I

Not to overgeneralize, but Greeks seem so PLEASANT! Laid back. Humorous. And just plan excellent at conversation.

The older people, in particular, have been uniquely unforgettable. Our morning began with an early dash to meet our tour bus, which it turns out was in fact picking us up at our hotel. What can I say? We have never taken a tour in our lives and are accustomed to finding our own way, so we naturally assumed we were supposed to meet our bus at the address on our paper.

Bewildered on a busy street, no bus in sight, we eventually found Gregory at the tour office. Surprised, amused, and placed in the very flustering position of impromptu entertaining at work, he regaled us with traveling impressions of New York City from a Greek perspective. He was thoroughly charming.

Standing on an office balcony, watching the city wake up and get to work, I felt like a part of things. Like I got a brief pass into a real Athenian life and was welcome there.

  
  

### Jack – Delphi

Before coming to Greece, I knew that if I could only see one place, it would probably be Delphi. I was not disappointed. After a magical bus ride through the mountains, we finally came to the old site of the greatest temple to Apollo in history.

Nestled on the slope of Mount Parnassus, I walked among the battered columns and tumbled stones, tracing ancient inscriptions and worn indentations where statues of heroes, philosophers, and deities used to stand.

I saw the stadium where the Pythian games were held in honor of the god every four years, and narrated Homer (quietly) in the theater.

Afterwards, I visited the museum and beheld all the wonders it displayed. I even saw some of the first musical notation, written on the walls of the temple to the god of song.

It was all I had hoped for.

  
  

### Jack – Close Encounters, Part II

Our next near shave happened in the museum at Delphi. Surrounded by looming statues and countless artifacts, we were in awe as the wonders of the ancients presented themselves.

After studying a particularly fabulous and intact sculpture of Socrates (which Dad couldn’t seem to get enough pictures of) my father wanted to do a goofy pose with it. As Dad struck a studious attitude alongside the old philosopher, and Mom tried to figure out how the camera worked, two museum docents hurriedly approached us and imparted (in somewhat broken English) that taking a picture of yourself with an artifact is very illegal and that Dad could get arrested or fined. They did neither however, and we left Socrates to pose by himself.

### Steven – Peace

Delphi is just a hop, skip, and a jump away from a lovely little port town that we only got to see from afar as we ate a huge late lunch. The weather was absolutely perfect and there was a charming porch area, but sadly, our tour group was led inside.

It was a nice enough place. We had a cordial lunch with some very polite world-hopping tourists, but the whole time I was aching to get outside into the warm breeze. So as soon as I shoveled down the last bite of food, I quietly snuck away from the table and across the street.

There, in the shade of a gnarled old tree, I stood beside a field simply packed with goats of all shapes, colors, and sizes, each with a bell clunking cheerfully around its neck. I looked up at the clouds as they drifted above the rugged mountains on either side. I breathed the moist, salt air coming up from the bay.

And I was at peace.

The past several years have been painfully difficult for me. But as I stood there, in a scene that would have looked only slightly different two thousand years ago, I felt the weight on my shoulders lift. It was a moment so perfect in its simplicity that I somehow managed to set aside all of my various burdens and just breathe.

The elves warn each other about the seaside. They say once you’ve gone there, you will never be fully content anywhere else.

I have only one more day to wait before meeting Ulmo again.

  
  

### Ellie – Lovely People, Part II

Tonight we jumped off our tour bus at the flea market stop below the Acropolis. Rosy sunset illuminating our marble skyline, we browsed through t-shirts and kitsch, and all grades of jewelry and antiques until the shops began to close, pulling down their metal doors one by one. Just as we were wandering off to find some dinner, one last shop caught Steven’s eye.

At the back were icons and ICONS from Mount Athos, and along one wall stood beautiful dishes, hand painted by women in their homes. A very old, very kind couple had run this shop unchanged for 40 years, and were delighted to chat about their wares. The woman’s face lit up as she spoke tenderly of each icon, explaining who was in it, and where it was written.

Sweetly inquiring about our itinerary, she listened politely as a I threw out a couple of island names from memory. Then, “And PATMOS! I’m most excited for Patmos” I exclaimed. Instantly, her whole self came alive in a new way. “Ah!” she cried, “That is my love, my love!” and poured over me, many words and gestures of spiritual excitement, which I could only barely decipher.

It was a pure heavenly moment between us, both our eyes shining as we shared Christ together. Hundreds of tourists go through her life every year, but I will never, ever forget her and her beautiful smile.
