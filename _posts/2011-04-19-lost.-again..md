        I was lost downtown (because I am lost anytime I get behind the wheel– and you can take that to the bank.) There was construction, there were one way streets, and there was an outstandingly unhelpful GPS telling me quite calmly that I should drive _the wrong way _down one of them. My children are, by now, so used to this sort of thing that we have an entire protocol designed exclusively for when Mommy’s driving. (i.e. shush on a dime, expect the scenic route, and be extra sweet if she bursts into tears.) It has developed organically over the the years and become a part of our family culture.

Most families dread the day their teenagers will drive. We anticipate that joyful day as one on which I will drive less often.

Part of this protocol includes Soothing Music. Jack switched on some techno trance and suddenly I was clothed in a shiny black leather cat suit swirving around asteroids and zeroing in on my target. I even held the steering wheel in a cooler, more confident grip. It was great to be a fighter pilot, even for just half an hour, even if I felt a little silly.

Trance music will definitely have to remain in this family’s driving culture. At least until the boys can take the minivan out for a spin.
