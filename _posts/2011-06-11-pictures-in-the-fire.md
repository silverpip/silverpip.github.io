Children’s bookstores (though not properly _for_ children as much as for those who _shop_ for children), stocked by wonderfully bookish people who love old books as well as new, are a rapidly vanishing delight, but rare gems can still be found here and there. I visited one today, in a last minute search for a perfect gift, and was nearly lost among the shelves of pictures, and verse, and lovely, lovely thoughts. Of course I found too many perfect gifts and then some, but also discovered a remarkable book which I did not buy (how very self-controlled of me) but instead sat down and savored from beginning to end. I hope I remember it forever. It is called _Pictures in the Fire_, and it fills me with a longing to know the personal history of the man in who’s ragged pocket the book’s manuscript was found. I’m certain his story was both tragic and beautiful, and died with him.

I left refreshed by his vision of life’s great goodness, and encouraged again to take up the task of living joyously in the present moment with my children. I love surprises.
