The fun Polly and I have bringing her for a haircut surprises me every time. It’s just an errand, right? One more thing to check off our list. But it’s not. It somehow manages to become an oasis of femininity in both our boy-filled lives. And I guess the pleasure surprises me because I don’t mind the boy-ness of our family one bit. Quite the reverse. A good tumbling rush suits me just fine.

But when we walk through those salon doors we are mysteriously confirmed as mother and daughter in a world of our own.

Polly feels grown-up, a woman among women, but groping her way through a new set of unspoken rules and expectations, paying close attention to everything, flashing her girliest smile, never saying a word except to me, in whispers. While we wait, she asks with the deepest interest about all the different products lining shimmery glass shelves. When the ladies exclaim over her beautiful haircut she swishes it for them then quickly glances to me to check if that was the right thing. On our way out, Polly fills her pockets with mints for her brothers at home, crazy excited to be bringing them treats.

Truthfully, this finding of her way in a different world is simply an extension of her friendships with girls in general. A bit out of her depth sometimes, just that touch off balance as she figures it out a little at a time. Discovering the power of words and learning how not to wield them. Finding a tactful way to include somebody shy. Puzzling over the degree to which she wants to stand out.

She is so sweet and valiant in her quest.
