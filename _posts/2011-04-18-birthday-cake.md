Oatmeal applesauce pound cake with lemon icing (a la _The Seven Silly Eaters_, see previous post) is an unlikely sounding birthday cake, but so scrumptious. Thomas specially requested it, but was so wrapped up in new toys he didn’t eat any, which is a first in my experience of family parties. None of the rest of us minded, however, as we ate slice after slice of butter and sugar and lemony yumm. I’ll save him a piece for breakfast.

The smell of baking cake as it sends little tendrils of warm sweetness curling under corners and up staircases, says more loudly than anything I can think of, _Stay a while. Rest your head here and let your hair down._

Maybe I feel that way because my own childhood home was often filled with warm and varied smells of baking, or maybe that feeling is inextricably linked with being human, but whichever the case, the thought of not baking makes my heart drop into my toes. I’m afraid I’ll never be a successful dieter.
