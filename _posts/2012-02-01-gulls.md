Gulls, hundreds of them lighting the sky, swooping and gliding over the Olentangy River at sunrise, stopped my breath. They were so beautiful, so startling, so silent and white. Not a single cry tore the morning with its longing, lonesome note, but that expanse of winged sky brought the sound unbidden to my inner ear. The breakers have been beating against my heart ever since. I must get down to the sea.

_Legolas Greenleaf long under tree_  
_ In joy thou hast lived. Beware of the Sea!_  
_ If thou hearest the cry of the gull on the shore,_  
_ Thy heart shall then rest in the forest no more._  
_â€“J.R.R. Tolkein, The Two Towers_
