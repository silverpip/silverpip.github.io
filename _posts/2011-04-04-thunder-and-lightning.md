        Driving through a terrifying thunder storm this morning, we saw a tree   
being hit by lightning. A great blue glowing ball of fire, then a   
sudden explosion of white sparks, right outside our window for that   
one second we were driving by. It was magnificent. It was something   
entirely new. Entirely new is a thing I crave from life. I never want to be rid of   
the familiar, I only want to add to it. I want new people, new sights,   
new smells to join the old ones in my life. 

 This would get crowded, I know, so probably it is all to the good that   
I can never indulge this craving as frequently as I would like. And I   
wrestle in my soul with the concept of Benedictine stability, and   
consider the need to sit on my inner flibberty-gibbet.  Because contentment would be a lip-smacking win. And there would   
always be trees struck by lightning to see along the road.
