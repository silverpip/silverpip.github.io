<h2>To Grandmother’s house we go</h2><p>Our lives become extremely chicken-centric while we’re visiting my parents: gathering eggs, saving our apple cores, perfecting our clucks. Except baby Nick, who still moos whenever he sees a chicken.</p><p>Spending Spring Break at my mom’s is great. Meals appear magically and I’ve grown a few extra arms to spread the love. Steven can squirrel himself away to write and write without worrying about my sanity, and if I sleep until the sun comes up, I know there’s plenty of breakfast and adult supervision going on downstairs.</p><p>Grandma Detox comes on Monday, but I’m just enjoying the high until then.</p></article>
