The down side to vacation is, well, vacationing. In a moment of grave overconfidence in my own character, I went ahead and started a mystery novel I’d been saving. Of course then I stayed up all night to finish it, and Oh! am I a grumpy, crotchety, stop-chatting-at-me-mommy today. Will I never learn?

Ah, but it was [a great one](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0312427360%2Fref%3Das_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl%3Fie%3DUTF8%26tag%3Dsilverpip-20%26linkCode%3Das2%26camp%3D1789%26creative%3D9325%26creativeASIN%3D0312427360&amp;t=YjUwYmUxYmI5ZmJmNWI0ZWNlNWI4ZWJlMjBlYWYxMWUyZjEwNGYyMixldGlJdms4Mg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3A-FRRJFFsFlqSwS3J4sl53A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fsilverpip-blog.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F48857081019%2F47244589&amp;m=1&amp;ts=1598221401). Sometimes, in the midst of a truly wonderful book, I can actually feel the frayed and fragmented bits of my inner landscape mending as I dive ever more deeply into it. It can be more refreshing than sleep, though not more restful. The drawback is that I cannot seem to stop living in the story’s grip until I’ve finished. Even when I exert superhuman self-control and put it down, I end up sleepwalking through the motions of life until I can pick it up again.

What’s a mom to do?
