We walked under a sputtering sort of drizzly sprinkle, the kind that makes the earth around our feet smell all brown and good, and dampens our cheeks while it cools our hearts. Strolling through light rain feels like pressing a big, satisfying reset button. 

It was only Nick, Polly, myself, and the dog. And we walked to get the zoomies out. Everybody’s zoomies. Except mine. I didn’t have any, not that close to bedtime.

The real downpour didn’t start until we had reached a great open meadow. And my plan worked like no plan ever has before. As I sat contentedly under a broad picnic roof, the others ran shrieking into the rain. Ducking under downspouts, kicking up puddles, blissfully zooming in circles until all the zoomies were gone.

A quiet bicyclist joined us, and a jogger dad with his toddler stopped for some shelter, while an old hobo sat down to get respectfully and affably drunk.

We had a grand storm in good company.
