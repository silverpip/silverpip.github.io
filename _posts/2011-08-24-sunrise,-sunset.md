         A sun drenched hilltop and the scent of baking meadow flowers transported me into that dream-state where I watch my own life as if from a wide angle lens. The children raced down the hill all around, tumbling into clover and shrieking with delight. One or two stopped a moment to watch some bees. Another crouched in the tall grass, silent and still as a bunny until I flushed her out. 

 I am living that far-off future life where I have six children _right now._ How did that happen? Like I blinked, and here I was. 

 Life is sort of magic.
