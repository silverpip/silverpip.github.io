Mad, lush summertime gives voice to all my varied passions. Spinning through its glowing days, I am dazzled beneath the lights and shadows of green leaves swaying, dancing overhead.

But the still gray horizons and sober husks of winter show me my handholds. Center my soul. Rain and mist and fog wash the landscape into clear neutrals. Columned trees raise black branches, spare even in their complexity, in a communal act of incarnate waiting.

In that moment before the merry-go-round at the park starts spinning, the grown-up says, “Does everyone have a bar? Hold on tight!” And then we spin. And spin. But that first moment may be the most wonderful of all, containing in itself the both the anticipation and the anchor, without which a good spin would only throw me to the ground in confused terror.

So I hold on tight, with a light heart in the cool clean rain, and wait with the trees.
