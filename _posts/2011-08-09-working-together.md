 I’ve been making Thomas and William take turns drying dishes, and by _making_, I really mean _the iron fist of swift justice dangles over our sink._ 

 The end result is sheer loveliness. Over the last two nights’ wash-ups have been some of the most important and sweet heart-to-hearts I’ve ever had with my children. And I didn’t have to coordinate anything at all. The confidences just spilled out, taking us both, I think, by surprise. 

 Maybe I should stop grumbling about my dishwasher-less state. 

 _Naaah._
