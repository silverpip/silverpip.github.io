I love the wind.

I could drink it in forever. Great gasps fill up every bit of me with unreasonable excitement. I holler. I whoop. I spin wildly in circles. I want to throw my hat in the air and kick up my heels.

The spring tang of it lingers at the tips of my hair long after we’ve blown back to our books, swishing around my face as I wash dishes and pick up toys and make _mooing_ sounds with Nick (Did you know storybook kitties _moo_? And sometimes ducks as well? Even sheep have a fondness for _moos_, although it usually comes out _boo_.) And I can still smell the wild, sweet wind in William’s hair, too, as I lean down to kiss the top of his head bent over arithmetic. A little wind in my face makes everything better. I can always do with a few less cobwebs.
