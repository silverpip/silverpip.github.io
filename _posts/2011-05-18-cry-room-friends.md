         Some of you may know about our 8 AM cry-room shenanigans on Sunday mornings. That is how we attend Mass, with just a couple other families who are also interested in letting the little ones run laps around the grown-ups while we worship together in chaos. Once in a while some of us even catch a phrase or two from the service. It is an aquired taste, but more pleasant than subjecting the entire congregation to our alternative lifestyle. Especially so early in the morning. 

 For a couple years now, there has been one other family in the cry-room regularly. We have smiled and exchanged the peace, grimaced sympathetically at awkward parenting moments, taught our children to share crayons and snacks in hurried whispers, seen each other have babies and watched those babies grow. 

 But we have not known each others’ names. 

 Last Sunday I decided this was silly, took my courage in both hands and casually mentioned how much we’d love to have them over. Well, it turns out that all these years they’ve thought we’re just wonderful and been dying to get to know us and see how we live. For goodness sake! 

 Pizza was at our house tonight. The kids played beautifully, of course. We’d already been working out our sharing styles for years. And the parents are very fun, interesting people who can chat comfortably while nerf darts zoom around their heads. It was a great time for everybody. 

 Now, that wasn’t so hard, was it?
