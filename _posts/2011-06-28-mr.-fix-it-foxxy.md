         When I was Polly’s age, my mother found a wee broken rocking chair discarded on the streets of Atlanta. She brought it home and gave it some mending and _hey presto_! The old red rocker found a home in my heart. 

 Now many years later, the top hanging bent and the arms wobbling sadly, it was in no condition to receive the love of six more children. But I couldn’t bear to see it on the curb. 

 Steven, as the very good sport he truly is, looked at my quivery lip, sighed, and moved it to the top of his project list. Applying his mysteriously magical fix-it touch, it became beatifully strong again. Now I have my little red rocker back for all six children to play on. 

 That makes me smile, and though it’s really too, too silly and Victorian to say out loud, I think my little red rocker smiles back. Since I’m pretty nearly certain I’m actually a Victorian in disguise, I’ll say it anyway. But I promise to draw no moral at the end.
