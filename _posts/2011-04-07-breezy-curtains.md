        An open window with a white curtain blowing gently in and out is, not heaven, which holds all sorts of theological considerations, but certainly paradise on earth.

On the first afternoon warm enough to open up the house and get that springy scent wafting from door to door, I invariably wonder just how I made it through the winter. All the fusty doldrums collected since November blow clean away. And even if a few open windows don’t really give me an actual clean slate, they make me feel as sparkly and fresh as if I had one, which is all I’m needing today.
