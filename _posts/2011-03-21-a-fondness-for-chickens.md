Today was one of those perfect, perfect days. There were wooded wanderings and fallings into creeks. There were on-schedule naptimes and me curled up in a rocker for an hour of lingering sunshine. There were fascinating facts dug excitedly out of library books and wondered over with brothers. There were jokes cracked and apples munched. There were manly tasks accomplished.

Granny Ann set Jack, Peter, William, and Thomas to work digging mud out of a section of driveway, only to check back in ten minutes to see four earnest heads bent together, shovels discarded on the ground, eight hands carefully scooping and sifting. The boys spent the next hour searching out lovely fat worms and feeding them tenderly to her chickens.

A lucky few made it into the garden, upon suggestion.

My children _really_ want some chickens of their own. But do our worms?
