        We just rolled in from another little road trip, out to visit some lovely retired Christian hippies at their vineyard. They were very sweet and hospitable, and the kids had a ball in the babbling brook out back, catching crayfish. Thomas fussed and fumed at me later when he had to put wet shoes back on. I told him that next time he shouldn’t wear them into the water. Sighing deeply and almost rolling his eyes in exasperation, he said, “Mom, I didn't_wear_them into the water. I_threw_them in."Tell us all your own favorite road trip story.
