        Breakfast cereal is a dismal excuse for a metaphor. Especially when referring to human beings. And used so tediously often… as in:

“I wouldn’t eat the same thing for breakfast every morning.”

Why can’t we use, say, books as our metaphor? People are so much more like books than they are like convenience food. Really good books, too. Rich layers of meaning and delicately interlacing plot lines. Multifaceted characters peppering our back stories and informing our presents. Themes, archetypes, heroics and villainies; empty moorlands and steamy jungles and quiet firesides all together landscaping one complex soul.

And there’s another thing. Breakfast cereal is chosen, dominated, and consumed at our good pleasure. Which makes it very safe. But persons are encountered only at our peril: we are changed and formed, and our pages scribbled on, or even torn.

I think it would be so lovely to leave little manuscript illuminations in everyone’s margins: gold and green dragons, and kings with curly beards and pointy red slippers.

There really are books deeply satisfying enough to spend a lifetime on. Marriage teaches us to reread.

Steven chuckled at my theory and told me that even his favorite books have bits he’d rather skip over, but that was only moments after I’d pulled the covers up sideways (which is a particular peeve of his) so I am discounting that viewpoint entirely.
