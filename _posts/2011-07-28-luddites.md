 The boys wanted to live without electricity or fossil fuels for a day. Which, really, is not that hard. It’s maintaining the lifestyle that’s difficult. 

 We stomped on our laundry in the tub and hung it out to dry. We rode our bikes to swimming lessons (and then had to turn around and drive the car after all, because the bike bridge was under construction. But they felt like it counted anyway.) We laid around and sweated all afternoon without air conditioning, playing board games. Concluding with a weenie roast and welcome cold baths, the experiment was, I think, more or less a success. 

 My favorite part was _no lights_. Glowing sunshine through wide open windows made the great outdoors beckon invitingly, so we spent much of our day out in it. As evening crept on, every member of the family wound down naturally towards bedtime, and there was considerably less mayhem. 

 But everyone agrees that life is a lot more work without electricity.
