         I have a bedroom. A sunny, breezy bedroom with white pillows and a blue and yellow quilt. It’s quiet in there all day long, even when Nick is napping or a big kid is reading on my bed. I’m almost never in it myself. But the simple fact of its existence stays somewhere in my mind, keeping a small corner of me tidy and composed. 

 Back when our bedroom was only the living room with the futon down, that quiet place was never there waiting. And although it felt awfully extravagant to set one frivolous room aside, our whole family is enriched now by the availability of retreat. 

 This room is not a bit necessary. Most of the world, I believe, lives without a dedicated bedroom. And yet I have been surprised to observe my own psychological phenomena concerning one. Is this due to the assumptions surrounding me in my own culture; do I feel I need a bedroom because my friends have one? Or is this connected to something more fundamentally human: this need for a breather and a space, which is accommodated otherwise in other cultures? I really don’t know, and I suspect it has something to do with both.
