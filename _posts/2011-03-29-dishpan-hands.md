        Submerging my hands in hot soapy water is the quickest settle-down-and-restart mechanism I know. Don’t misunderstand: my dishes never (and I do mean never) actually get scrubbed until the job becomes mission critical. Which is a stressful and difficult way to live, but that’s a post for a different day (and a different person.) Today, I am talking about the pure sensory balm the chore spreads on my soul when I finally buckle down to it. Maybe the restart feeling also has something to do with rescuing counter space for a new project; maybe it gives me a false sense of virtue to get some housework done once in a while, but mostly I just associate that feeling of “_ahhh_” with the actual moment of hands-in-hot-suds. 

 Lovely to have done those dishes tonight. Lovely.
