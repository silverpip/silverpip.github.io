        *    Few will run or bike in a downpour, so I am alone with the geese and the groaning river. I remove my glasses in order to see, and water streams continuously into my eyes. Colors and smells are clearer in a half blind state, and my feet are so far out of visual range that I crash splashing into deep puddles without foreknowledge. 
*    Long, white living room curtains blow straight out into my face as Nick and I sing nursery rhymes in a chair together. Their fabric is insistent, roiling with passion, suggesting dangerous ocean schooner voyages and desperate battlefield truces. We switch to sea chanties. 
*    Thunder crashes in the night, making my heart pound, my toes tingle. Even as a child, it has only ever excited me, made me awake and aware and absolutely alive. I always half want to be out in the thick of it. Instead I lie in the dark, listening to rushing gutters and pattering eaves. Once I slept under a corrugated metal roof while the heavens opened. Oh delight. The snugness and security of being tucked up under Godâ€™s wing feels especially present to me during a rainstorm in the wee small hours.
