        (My pregnant brain thought I posted this a month ago, and then my postpartum brain found I hadnâ€™t. But I like it, so I am posting it now, enjoying the novelty of time travel.)

I am never such an insomniac as when I am nine months pregnant. Normally, my problems are quite the opposite. I sleep too deeply, for too long, and the bad effects of a nap upon me are the stuff of legend.

But now I prowl the house, eating burritos at 3 am, shuffling to the bathroom again and again, sighing deeply as I roll over in bed and pull the covers off my dear long-suffering husband. Long interludes pass, curled up under my quilts and around thousands of pillows, just listening to the breathing of my true love and watching the moon sail silently along.This is a blessed space of quiet in the midst of hectic days: just lying here being happy, without demands or needs or any thoughts but my own.

Very soon my sleep will become again like the sex of the sixties: anytime, anywhere. Too frequently interrupted by the incessant needs of another. Care taking fatigue will fog my brain and cloud my judgements. It will be another kind of time, my self broken and poured out, the sweetness of it coloring my days; the soul I call my Self a weeping puddle of exhausted need.

So I am shoring up the quiet. I am filling up with the longing and stillness of these wakeful midnights against the time to come. It is my own tiny advent. And I keep a candle burning in the window of my heart as I wait in darkness for the coming of a child.
