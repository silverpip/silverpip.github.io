         My sons and some friends keep a club they call the T. C. W. P., or, Totally Cool Writing People, in which they gather to make stories together. We moms call them the Shrinklings (full credit to Amy) and feel they need a more pub-like atmosphere to truly flourish. The children themselves tend to take mild offense to this fond nickname, as diminutive or somehow head-patting; no matter how we explain about Lewis and Tolkein and the rest, we seem to be Not Taking Their Art Seriously. So we refrain. 

 But oh, the earnest moments with heads bent together as I tiptoe quietly away, followed shortly by pealing giggles down the stairs. They are very, very cute. 

 So excited by it all, I initially poured my enthusiasm into making suggestions for how the club might run, etc. But after recieving several crushing “Are those three heads Mom’s sprouting?” looks, I left it be. 

 It surprised me how pernicious was the urge to corral and control. I have lately enjoyed, when facing this, closing my eyes and imagining myself throwing a handful of papers, or marbles, or leaves into the air and then walking on, never looking back as everything I have been juggling falls to the ground and sorts itself out without me. 

 This club is their thing. I tiptoe from the room again.
