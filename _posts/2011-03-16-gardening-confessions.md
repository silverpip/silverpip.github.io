I have not yet grown a successful vegetable. This fact in no way keeps me from planting seeds every single year, like a garden sacrament. It is the outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace: hope. And as the spring thaws and the little seedlings sprout, my joy increases. The summer winds on, I become preoccupied with many things; the waiting and careful tending overcome me with tedium. Never entirely forgetting my garden, I care for it sporadically in great gluts of work interspersed by long periods of abject neglect. Harvest time comes as a surprise with little to show but some spindly plants and a really heroic couple of tomatoes or squashes, and I vow to do better next spring, which is not really the time of year to be vowing about, as it is my summer habits which need an overhaul.

It occurs to me this manifests throughout my life. I show up expectantly for all my plantings, for all my sacraments, for all my renewals. I notice joyfully the tender new seedlings and unfurling baby shoots. I am easily overcome and derailed in the simple discipline of daily routine, and my fruit is sparse at the end of the day. Continually planting, perpetually in springtime. It is a nice time to be in, but I think I need some summer and some harvest, too.

I planted my peas yesterday.
