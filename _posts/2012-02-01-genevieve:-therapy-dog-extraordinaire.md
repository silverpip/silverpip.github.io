Ours is the weeniest dog in creation. Her name is Genevieve, and we call her our sheep in wolf’s clothing. She tenderly loves quixotic and unpredictable humans, patiently enduring even Nick sticking fingers up her nose and choke-holding her neck in the exuberance of true love. But she cannot abide looming objects.

This is difficult. She couldn’t share the living room with a Christmas tree. She was suspicious of her food rack for weeks. And she has made some sort of religious vow never to walk by the picnic shelter at our park. That last one is a problem because we really _must_ walk by it to get to our park at all. More than once I’ve found myself trudging past with a great, sad-eyed, muddy Golden Retriever in my arms and six children dancing along behind. Such a spectacle.

This morning Genevieve woke Steven up at four a.m. to go outside. Five hours afterward as he napped, I hopped into the shower (everyone was playing _sooo_ nicely.) In mere moments, just as hot water roared past my ears and all the morning tensions swirled sweetly away, Steven banged spluttering into the bathroom, indignantly half asleep and wondering what exactly I was up to, to leave the household in such an uproar. Uproar?

Ketchup, mustard, and butter were spread through the house. Nick had carried the dog’s water bowl about, baptizing toys as he went, and finally dropping it outside our bedroom. Genevieve, terrified by the clanging, braved both a looming bookshelf and the not insubstantial height of our bed, hurtling herself onto Steven’s sleeping head, suddenly sleeping no more. He sat up, pushing her back to Nick, who promptly clanged the dish again, sending a hairy white doggy-breathed missile right back onto his head.

I laughed until I was week in the knees, though Steven was terribly dignified. I love it when he takes care of the kids.
