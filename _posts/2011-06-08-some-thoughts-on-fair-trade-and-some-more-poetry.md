A few months ago, I went to the store to buy soap, and had some trouble choosing. Now, this is not strange, since too many options often fluster me, and I have been known to leave a store without any product at all rather than deal with an overwhelming number of choices. A friend of mine who lives overseas calls it “decision anxiety” and is usually immobilized in U.S. grocery stores.

But this time wasn’t my run of the mill brand confusion. My choice was between a soap I was already comfortable with and a new Fair Trade variety. For whatever reason, I finally left with the old soap in my bag. Perhaps I was feeling poor that day, or just couldn’t bear standing in the aisle any longer and grabbed at familiarity before making a run for it. I had forgotten the incident altogether.Until yesterday.

Reading “The Chimney Sweeper” from William Blake’s _Songs of Innocence_ to Thomas, I began weeping halfway through, because, well, little sweeps were real children once upon a time. The poem itself is a beautiful look at individual redemption within the context of suffering and our human condition, and I encourage everyone to check it out below. But that’s not what I’m thinking through right this second.

I, at least, tend to feel we’ve rid society of the worst sorts of evils associated with cheap comfort, ease, and industrialization. But really, we’ve just sent them to other countries where we don’t have to look at our victims calling on street corners, or face the robbed childhoods and plundered futures of our manufacturers’ families.

From my exceptionally ill-educated perspective, Fair Trade seems our best hope of changing this murky system. But so far, most products are luxury items. I don’t use many silk scarves or specialty coffees. And I am generally bewildered by the disorganized world of Fair Trade marketing.

But when confronted in my face by an easy choice of a few extra bucks for some Fair Trade soap, I left the store without it. Plenty of people still hired child abusing sweeps to clean their chimneys long after viable alternatives were available. It was cheaper.

Mea Culpa.

_“The Chimney Sweeper” by William Blake_

_When my mother died I was very young,_  
_ And my father sold me while yet my tongue,_  
_ Could scarcely cry weep weep weep weep,_  
_ So your chimneys I sweep &amp; in soot I sleep._

_Theres little Tom Dacre, who cried when his head_  
_ That curled like a lambs back was shav’d, so I said._  
_ Hush Tom never mind it, for when your head’s bare,_  
_ You know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair_

_And so he was quiet. &amp; that very night._  
_ As Tom was a sleeping he had such a sight_  
_ That thousands of sweepers Dick, Joe, Ned, &amp; Jack_  
_ Were all of them lock’d up in coffins of black,_

_And by came an Angel who had a bright key_  
_ And he open’d the coffins &amp; set them all free._  
_ Then down a green plain leaping laughing they run_  
_ And wash in a river and shine in the Sun._

_Then naked &amp; white, all their bags left behind._  
_ They rise upon clouds, and sport in the wind._  
_ And the Angel told Tom, if he’d be a good boy,_  
_ He’d have God for his father &amp; never want joy._

_And so Tom awoke and we rose in the dark_  
_ And got with our bags &amp; our brushes to work._  
_ Tho’ the morning was cold, Tom was happy &amp; warm_  
_ So if all do their duty, they need not fear harm._
