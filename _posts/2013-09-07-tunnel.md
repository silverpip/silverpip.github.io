Sometimes we walk to school, now that Thomas and Polly go.

No matter how the larks take wing and the Black-eyed Susans wink, my childrenâ€™s very favorite bit is always the little concrete tunnel which takes us under the street. It is locked at all other times. And they have been wondering and wondering about it just forever.

So now they get to enter that mysterious other-world, and hear the cars rumbling over their heads, and take turns carrying the umbrella stroller like a stretcher down and up the stairs.

This tunnel is a magic place, gritty with graffiti and partly orange under glaring lights. My children love its shiver and its glamour.
