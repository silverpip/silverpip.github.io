 The Rule of Escalation on water wars in our family is intense, especially with two middle-school aged boys around (three, if you count Steven, which I usually do.) Everyone thinks twice about that first dousing, but once engaged, the battle will not end before a full-body drenching for everyone. 

 I was inducted into this little way of life while Steven and I were still dating. Washing a car together one hot Texan day, I playfully squirted the hose at his shirt for mere moments. Soon finding myself soaked to the skin with a hose tucked down the back of my pants, standing ankle deep in a rushing river, I knew exactly what I was getting into when I agreed to marry the man. 

 He has passed down this legacy to his sons. This morning Jack accidentally-on-purpose flushed the toilet during Steven’s shower. “OOPS!” he giggled wickedly. 

 His shower was next, and it quickly devolved into a bathtubful of ice cubes over his shoulders and around his feet. The two laughed themselves silly and emerged as fast friends. 

 Boys are weird.
