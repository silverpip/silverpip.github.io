 Summer evening strolls are a luxury I had almost forgotten after twelve years of early baby bedtimes. But we went a little wild tonight and took one one anyway. 

 I soaked in those particular dusky summer smells, everyoneâ€™s front stoop flowers pressed in the gathered heat of the whole day; so changed from the fresh dewy mornings, so languorous. 

 Quiet folk reading under porch roofs, chatty friends visiting on open decks, babies put to bed sweetly through open windows: this is a different neighborhood at bedtime. Here are no heavy-eyed coffee swillers trying to start their cars, or fancy ladies waiting at the bus stop. No one trying to hurry to anywhere else. No bright morning faces, just folks doing their own thing, their real thing. 

 I like this place.
