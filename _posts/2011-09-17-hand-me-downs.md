        Bags of glorious hand-me-downs arrived tonight, and made for an enchanted evening. A new dollhouse and some remarkable squeaky shoes (?!) kept everyone happy until bedtime, which was great, since I previously hadnâ€™t a clue what to do with us all.

A little novelty goes a long way around here.

It was more than simple novelty, though, which made the night warm. The knowledge that each new treasure: toy, book, or hoodie, had been loved and worn and played with by beloved cousins worked its way through each discovery.

I feel so lucky to be raising my kids in the greater context of cousins, grandparents, aunts and uncles. Many live far away, but the steady influx of hand-me-downs keeps the fact of them very present and touchable to my children.
