        _Here is Edward Bear, coming downstairs now, bump, bump, bump, on the back of his head, behind Christopher Robin. It is, as far as he knows, the only way of coming downstairs, but sometimes he feels that there really is another way, if only he could stop bumping for a moment and think of it. And then he feels that perhaps there isn’t.__  
- Winnie the Pooh, A.A. Milne_

Peter has realized that the unquestionably superior way of getting downstairs is to leap from as high a step as he can and stick the landing. This shivers our timbers from stem to stern, but has become, despite all attempts to the contrary, a fixture in our family life, spreading itself virally, as great ideas do, to the other children.

If anyone ever sneaks downstairs you may be sure they’ve got a nerf gun concealed somewhere on their person, fully cocked and loaded.
