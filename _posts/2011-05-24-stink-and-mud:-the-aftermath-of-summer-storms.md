 The day after that glorious run in the driving rain, my shoes are still soaked, and starting to reek. We have a tiny entrance stair sandwiched between two front doors which we affectionately call The Stinky Shoe Room. I once absentmindedly referred to it merely as The Shoe Room, and was quickly corrected. I have not made the same mistake twice. Old wet running shoes add whole new layers to the idea, or Platonic Form, of stinky. I almost thought I saw cartoon wisps of stink curling up from them this morning as I wrestled my feet in. 

 Our backyard is a mud wrestling pit, pure and simple. When Steven and I gingerly traverse it to drink our tea out under the trees, our bare morning toes sink and squish, and make slurpy sucking sounds as they resurface. OK, that part is sort of great, but the aftermath on the kitchen floor is less so. We had a neighborly tea party today, and the elegantly white tablecloth swept the nether muck in artistic dissonance.
