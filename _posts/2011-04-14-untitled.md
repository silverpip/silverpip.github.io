<h2>Not that it’s Armistice Day…</h2><p>Jack and Peter and I are studying World War I. This kind of history is still recent enough to keep some of its blood and guts, and can be a little emotional. After an hour or so in the trenches, knee deep with mud and rats, the boys took a break. Jack brought this Lego depiction of Flanders’ Fields up to dinner. The Lego medium almost made me want to laugh, but it touched me to see how moved my son was, on the cusp of manhood, by the sacrifices of other young men in the battlefield. And it made me pray fervently that he would not be required to know those sacrifices more personally.</p><p><em>In Flanders fields the poppies blow<br/>Between the crosses, row on row,<br/>That mark our place; and in the sky<br/>The larks, still bravely singing, fly<br/>Scarce heard amid the guns below.We are the Dead. Short days ago<br/>We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,<br/>Loved and were loved, and now we lie,<br/>In Flanders fields…</em></p><p><em>– Lieutenant Colonel John McCrae </em></p><p><span></span></p></article>
