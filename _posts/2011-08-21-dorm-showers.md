 Blithely stepping from the shower during my recent homeschooling momsâ€™ retreat, the awful truth dawned: I had forgotten my towel back in the room. 

 Soaked and shivering over cold dorm-style bathroom tiles, I spent the next several minutes frantically waving my arms around in front of the paper towel dispenser, pulling tiny squares of scratchy brown paper, blotting a few drips and repeating the process again and again. Eventually I dried enough (by evaporation as much as anything else) to pull on my clothes and dash back to the room where I finished my hair with a proper towel. Terrycloth never felt so good. 

 It was a minor mishap, of the sort which happens rather frequently to me, so I soldiered on and enjoyed breakfast enormously. 

 I had a lovely retreat.
