        _Metaphors_

_I’m a riddle in nine syllables,  
 An elephant, a ponderous house,  
 A melon strolling on two tendrils.  
 O red fruit, ivory, fine timbers!  
 This loaf’s big with its yeasty rising.  
 Money’s new-minted in this fat purse.  
 I’m a means, a stage, a cow in calf.  
 I’ve eaten a bag of green apples,  
 Boarded the train there’s no getting off._

_–Sylvia Plath_

I am as round and fat as a butterball, and I do not know how this baby can get much bigger. But he will. Oh, _will he ever_.

Pregnancy is the most surreal experience I know.
