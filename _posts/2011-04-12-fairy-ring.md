        I was up and out to the car this morning before the sun. No wind blew, and the rain fell softly pattering on my hair, my shoulders. It gathered in a river down to the drain. Everything felt very swishy and dreamlike, but the most magical part of all was the twinkly winkly raindrops bouncing off the pavement under a streetlight, a perfect circle of dancing fairy lights. I believe I ought to have made three wishes.

1. (since I listened to NPR as soon as the key turned in the ignition) World Peace

2. (since there seems to be, oddly, only daffodil leaves coming up in my backyard) Daffodil Buds

3. (since Nick wonâ€™t stop climbing on the table and throwing everything else off it) Lots of Really Great Chocolate and a Nap. Oops, was that four?
