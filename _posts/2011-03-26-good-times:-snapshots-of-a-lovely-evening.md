A favorite park, empty of everyone else in the wintery sunshine, my children’s shouts rising sweet and clear above the sound of a rushing creek nearby, swollen with melted snow and sparking bright.

The fervor in Thomas’ face as he searches out a certain longed-for book about volcanoes in the library display case.

Great friends, good food, and a glass of wine while bands of children roam free and loud upstairs. Laughing and music and lots of talk.Sleepy snuggles when we bring the babies home far past bedtime and tuck them in, masterfully solving the great blanket-swap caper in the process. 

If every night was like this one, would I take it for granted and grow discontent?
