<h2>Muddy Ballerinas</h2><p class="p1">Polly sang of sweet girlhood in her sheer pink tutu with purple sneakers, and I simply floated in a lovely, light little sundress and a scarf round my head. This sparkly July morning, we both felt pristinely feminine.</p><p class="p1">The Boys spotted a gurgling ribbon of water far below our sedate walking trail and nothing would do but to dive down the hill and under a bridge.</p><p class="p1">Stifling an unworthy sigh (for my dress) I plunged after, and we spent a blissful morning catching frogs and crayfish, squealing at tiny sunbathing centipedes, and splashing up small waterfalls punctuated by still pools. Soaked and muddy, climbing back out to civilization an hour or two later, we looked a sight. A happy sight, but not a tidy one. Or even an especially feminine one, except insofar as frog-slimed tutus are feminine.</p></article>
