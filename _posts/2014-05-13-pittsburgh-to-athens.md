### Steven – Airports

We arrived at the airport ridiculously early with a full two hours to spare. So we sat together, giggling in anticipation of our upcoming adventure, buying comfy neck-pillows, and eating the bagel sandwiches that (for some reason) poor, tired Rhonda at Bruegger’s just couldn’t seem to get right. In the end, Jack ended up with onions and I only narrowly escaped having turkey thrust upon on my veggies.

Our first non-American adventure was at the airport in Munich, Germany. You know how everywhere you go in America there is music blaring? And how in airports, the music is always being interrupted by long annoying messages reminding you for the umpteenth time not to leave your luggage unattended?

The Munich airport is quiet.

No music. Few announcements. Lots of pristine, modern, glass-walled corridors with precise sans-serifs in bold, easy-to-read colors.

I loved it.

Oh yes. AND we saw this really cool car:

When we went through the security checkpoint and these two lovely people, who seemed barely able to smile, cheerfully rummaged through our stuff and put everything right back where they had found it.

It was a strange experience for me.

I had an incident in a German airport back in 1994. Right after my jacket had gone through the scanner a very concerned, very large and intimidating man pulled me aside, looked me straight in the eyes, and said…

“Do you have a pistol in your pocket?”

My little 18 year-old brain panicked. Of course I don’t have a pistol in my pocket! I don’t own a pistol. What’s going on? Did somebody else have a pistol in their pocket and this guy has mixed us up? DID SOMEONE PLANT A GUN ON ME!? WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO TO ME!?!?!

The large, intimidating man thoroughly checked every pocket of my jacket and then slowly, carefully pulled out a bright green and orange water pistol. He was similarly unable to produce a full-fledged smile, but he cheerfully put my water gun back in my pocket and, with just the slightest twinkle in his eye, sent me on my merry way.

I assumed that this quirky mixture of clipped precision and the ability to let the little things slide would be dead in our post-9/11 world. But it wasn’t. Germany felt exactly the same to me as it did way back in 1994. No nonsense. But no panic either.

It stood in stark contrast to the long lines of people herded like cattle through the Gauntlet of Intimidation run by Team TSA. In the US, I am terrified every time I go through a checkpoint. Have I forgotten some small, harmless metal object in my pocket? Did I remember to pack all of my liquids in appropriately small containers? Am I still supposed to take my shoes off?

I just think it’s interesting to note that the US now feels so much like a police state that even Germany comes across as laid back.

### Jack – The Streets of Athens

Everything is crazy here! A couple of cool differences that I’ve noticed so far:

The billboards alongside our Metro route were done all by hand, mostly with spray paint and tape. The kids here apparently are naturals at the accordion. Two of them walked up and down the aisles, while their little sister handed around a cup for change.

The traffic lights have only one light for each side of the road. When it changes, there is a mad rush to get across the street all at once. Also, there are tons of motorcycles everywhere (including the sidewalks) so traffic is a little insane sometimes. And when walking you must be careful not to squash any pigeons underfoot.

I’m still rather intimidated by the police here. Equipped with combat armor, hand guns, multiple nightsticks, assault rifles, and riot shields, they truly are the Batmen of Athens.



### Ellie – Shoes, etc.

Athens is a wholly new kind of place for me. People are everywhere: talking, walking, motorbiking, smelling like flowery perfumes and wearing fantastic shoes. There are orange trees lining streets and standing in courtyards. They grow alone and in groups. Ripe fruit hangs unheeded over sidewalks. My heart still skips a little every time I see an orange tree. Maybe I will get used to them tomorrow.

Nah!

I grow very fond of our hotel’s teeny-tiny baby elevator. We three squish in together (I would LOVE to get ALL my kids into there ;-) and it brings us down, down to the street which happens to be lined with remarkably fabulous shoe stores. I don’t have any real sense of what one might shop for in Athens, other than shoes.

… and the art history here is mind-blowingly interesting, and the street gyros are incredibly delicious, and the worn-down ancient mountains flicking past me on the tram manage to inspire even while bristling with cell phone towers.

Yes. That’s how cool they are.



### Steven - Byzantine Art

<figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="334" data-orig-src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/8f84a867fb40b787b0f37bdc47ab033d/tumblr_inline_n5j19vzbki1qgdtwd.jpg" data-orig-width="500"><img alt="image" data-orig-height="334" data-orig-src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/8f84a867fb40b787b0f37bdc47ab033d/tumblr_inline_n5j19vzbki1qgdtwd.jpg" data-orig-width="500" height="334" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/ff4871dca8f52d83de080e7ecf04fb00/tumblr_inline_pjzsf8xtj21qgdtwd_500.jpg" width="500"/></figure>

I adored the Byzantine Museum. It’s arranged chronologically, taking you from the first few centuries of Christian art, all the way up to the present.

I was simply charmed by the statue of Christ the Philosopher, carved all in curvy marble and carrying a scroll.

I was literally short of breath when I walked into a room filled with giant wooden panels, suspended in midair, and decorated on both sides with impossibly ancient, termite-nibbled iconography.

I was SO SAD when the gift shop was closed because the workers were “on strike” even though the rest of the museum seemed to be in perfect running order.



### Ellie – Bedtime

In the morning, we will see some sights and be sobered by a great weight of time and history, but tonight I am happy under the orange trees, a strange tongue flowing over me from all sides, a funny little elevator, and a soft pillow for my poor, aching, jet-lagged head.
