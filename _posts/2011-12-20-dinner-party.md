        Every month we join a potluck dinner at the community resource center on our street. It’s just a friendly spot for anyone down on their luck, and I love how the place feels. Happy, like it belongs to the real people it serves.

Because of December, communication tangled, and they thought we had cancelled while we thought we hadn’t. So our whole group wound up enjoying a magnificent dinner with just three regulars, and bringing home some surplus fruits and vegetables to boot.

Like I threw a great party for someone, and it turned out a surprise party for me!
