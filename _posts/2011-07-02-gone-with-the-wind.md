 The air conditioning in the van gave out its last tepid breath halfway to Pittsburgh. So we rode down the highway in a roaring wind, and it felt like the good old days to me, up in that front seat, because I cannot hang bare toes out the window and wiggle them in the wind if there is air conditioning. 

 I also cannot sing _Feliz Navidad_ (remember Peter was in charge of the music) at quite such an epic volume if there is air conditioning. I love that the wind snatches my voice and carries it far away, however loudly I might shout. 

 We will fix it. Alas, the back windows aren’t built for blowing. And I do love my children. I don’t really want their precious little heads sweating in the stifling heat every time we take a drive. But maybe sometimes when it’s just me, I’ll roll down the windows and sing a bit.
