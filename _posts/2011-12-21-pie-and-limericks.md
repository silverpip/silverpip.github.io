        <div>Our kitchen has been covered by pies in various stages of development for a couple days now, and Nick is very interested. This morning I heard him galloping into the living room singing, (to the tune of “Oh, Christmas Tree”) “Oh, Cwithmuth Pie! Oh, Cwithmuth Pie!” over and over again.</div>

<div>In related seasonal news, Jack read me this gem today:</div>

<div>King Wenceslas heard someone shout</div>

<div>“There’s a boy with a snowball about!”</div>

<div>It went straight in his ear;</div>

<div>Since when, every year,</div>

<div>The good king has always looked out.</div>
