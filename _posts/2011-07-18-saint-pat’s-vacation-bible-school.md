         Teenage boys tenderly carrying sleepy toddlers. Children waiting patiently, chatting pleasantly around the hall. Games of tag morphing and blending inclusively. No one sitting alone who’d rather not. (Why would they? There’re plenty of siblings to go around. Here, have mine a while!) Moms holding up three simultaneous conversations with different ages while maneuvering everyone to gigantic, ancient vans. And most healing of all to my self-questioning heart: each mom wore the same slightly dazed expression I feel on my own face. Each spoke in the same “I’m trying really hard to be patient and almost succeeding” voice I hear from my own lips every day. Hairstyles somewhat askew, makeup truly optional, twinges of hysteria in their laughs, deep pools of joy and peace behind their eyes. They can never crane round their necks far enough to see themselves, but those pools are there for everyone else to drink of deeply. 

 As an anthropologist, I finally tracked where all the large Catholic homeschooling families go for a week in July. And my kids had a wonderful time.
